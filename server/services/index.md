# System Services — Public Overview

This directory serves as a public placeholder for BBS backend services.

The technical implementation of internal system services is distributed 
across protected components of the BBS ecosystem and is not included 
in the public repository.

This folder exists to maintain documentation consistency and prevent 
broken links in earlier drafts.

Public service interfaces will be documented here as the ecosystem 
reaches later development stages.
