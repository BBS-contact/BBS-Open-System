# Doors — Ethical Access and Intent-Based Authorization System

The Doors subsystem defines how access is granted within the BBS ecosystem.
It is a revolutionary model where **ethics and behaviour** — not rank,
status, or authority — determine what a person or system is allowed to do.

Traditional access control relies on:
- hierarchy,
- positions,
- privilege.

BBS replaces this with **ethical, behavioural access paths**.

---

## Purpose

To ensure that access is:
- fair,
- transparent,
- context-aware,
- behaviour-based,
- incorruptible.

No person, administrator, or authority can bypass these rules.

---

## Core Principles

### • Ethics before hierarchy  
No one receives access because of position — only through ethical alignment.

### • Intent before permission  
Why you act matters more than what you try to access.

### • Consistency before privilege  
Behaviour over time determines trust and access levels.

### • Zero backdoors  
No hidden systems, “special admin rights,” or silent overrides.

### • Transparent access history  
Every access attempt is logged and explainable.

## System Components (Public Overview)

1. **Intent-Based Authorization Engine**  
   Evaluates the purpose behind each action before granting access.

2. **Behavioural Trust Model**  
   Access grows or shrinks based on long-term behavioural consistency.

3. **Ethical Access Framework**  
   Defines what actions require what levels of responsibility and care.

4. **Zero-Privilege Structure**  
   Administrators have no automatic special rights.

5. **Access Integrity Trail**  
   Immutable logs of access attempts, outcomes, and ethical context.

## Why It Matters

Modern systems fail because:
- admins can override rules,
- corruption creates hidden access,
- privileged users can manipulate data.

BBS eliminates these vulnerabilities by:
- removing privilege,
- enforcing transparency,
- linking access to ethics,
- making behaviour accountable,
- ensuring incorruptibility.

Access becomes a **moral responsibility**, not a badge of authority.

## Development Status

The Doors subsystem is conceptually complete.
Implementation details remain protected until safety,
alignment, and verification standards are established.
