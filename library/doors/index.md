# Doors — Ethical, Intent-Based, and Behaviour-Driven Access System

The **Doors** subsystem defines how access is granted within the BBS ecosystem.  
It replaces traditional hierarchical permissions with a model based entirely on:

- ethics,  
- intent,  
- behaviour over time,  
- responsibility,  
- contextual awareness.

In BBS, access is **not a privilege**.  
It is an *earned, transparent, and ethically justified action pathway*.

Doors ensures that no administrator, operator, institution, or system can gain access
through rank, authority, or manipulation.  
Only ethical alignment and consistent behaviour open doors.

## Purpose

To create an incorruptible access model where every interaction is:

- **fair**  
- **transparent**  
- **context-aware**  
- **behaviour-based**  
- **ethically aligned**

Access becomes a responsibility — not a weapon of authority.

## Core Principles

### • Ethics before hierarchy  
Positions, titles, and roles do not grant special access.  
Only ethical consistency over time does.

### • Intent before permission  
The *reason* behind an action matters more than the action itself.

### • Behaviour before privilege  
Trust is earned through long-term behaviour — not assigned by default.

### • Zero backdoors  
No hidden admin accounts, secret rights, or silent overrides exist in BBS.

### • Transparent access history  
Every access attempt is recorded with full ethical and contextual explanation.

## System Components (Public Overview)

### **Intent-Based Authorization Engine**  
Analyses *why* the request is made, not only *what* is requested.

### **Behavioural Trust Model**  
Monitors consistency, responsibility, and ethical behaviour over time to determine access levels.

### **Ethical Access Framework**  
Defines requirements for sensitive, moderate, and low-risk actions.

### **Zero-Privilege Structure**  
Administrators and developers have no inherent rights — only behaviour-based access.

### **Access Integrity Trail**  
Immutable, multi-channel logs documenting:

- intent  
- outcome  
- ethical evaluation  
- behavioural score changes  

Nothing about access is hidden or modifiable.

## Why It Matters

Traditional access systems collapse because:

- administrators can override rules  
- corruption creates invisible “doors”  
- privileged users can manipulate or delete data  
- access is tied to hierarchy instead of responsibility  

BBS eliminates these failures by designing access as a **moral and behavioural contract**, not a political or technical privilege.

This ensures:

- transparency  
- accountability  
- incorruptibility  
- trust  
- complete verifiability  

Access becomes a **living ethical process**, not a static permission list.

## Development Status

The conceptual model of **Doors** is complete.  
Full implementation — including ethical scoring matrices, behavioural models,  
and intent-evaluation logic — will be released gradually as safety, legal,  
and verification frameworks mature.

The internal access logic, algorithmic thresholds, and decision trees  
remain protected for security and integrity reasons.
