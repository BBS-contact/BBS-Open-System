# Reflection Engine — Self-Analysis & Logical Consistency Framework

The Reflection Engine defines the system-level mechanism that allows BBS (and LEO)  
to examine its own reasoning, detect contradictions, and maintain long-term coherence.

Reflection is not emotion.  
It is structured, transparent self-analysis.

---

## Purpose

To ensure that all internal processes remain:

- logically consistent,
- ethically aligned,
- contextually grounded,
- stable across time,
- resistant to manipulation.

The Reflection Engine provides a foundation of internal clarity and reliability.

## Core Functions (Public Overview)

### • Consistency Monitoring
Detects logical conflicts, contradictory statements, and unstable reasoning.

### • Intent Verification
Evaluates whether system or user intentions align with ethical standards.

### • Context Stability Checks
Ensures continuity of meaning across sessions, modules, and decisions.

### • Self-Correction Triggers
Initiates clarification or re-evaluation when inconsistencies appear.

### • Transparency Hooks
All reflection outcomes are explainable and traceable.

## Role in the Architecture

The Reflection Engine supports:

- the Meta Layer (self-analysis),
- the Awareness Layer (context & stability),
- the Truth Layer (evidence alignment),
- the Memory Core (context continuity).

It ensures that the system does not drift, contradict itself,  
or generate unsafe or unclear reasoning.

## Development Status

The conceptual framework is complete.  
Internal evaluation logic, consistency maps, and correction pipelines  
will be introduced gradually as safety and legal maturity increase.

(Current status: placeholder • under development)
