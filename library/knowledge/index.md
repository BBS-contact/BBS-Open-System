# Knowledge Library — Semantic Global Information Framework (Public Overview)

The Knowledge Library defines the conceptual foundation for how BBS 
structures, validates, and organizes verified information across 
all modules and systems.

This directory serves as a public entry point for the Knowledge Layer.
Technical mechanisms, semantic mappings, and internal data models 
are not included in the public repository.

## Purpose
• Provide a unified, verified knowledge structure  
• Support LEO with consistent contextual information  
• Prevent misinformation, fragmentation, and contradictory data  
• Enable cross-module semantic alignment  

## Why This Page Exists
The Knowledge Library is a core element of the BBS Library Layer and 
is referenced throughout the documentation.

This folder prevents broken links and provides a stable, conceptual 
overview without exposing protected logic.

Internal implementations will be introduced in later development stages 
as safety and integrity requirements are met.
