# Mirrors — Intent Reflection and Behaviour Transparency Layer

The Mirrors subsystem is the ethical and analytical layer of BBS
that reflects user intentions, behaviours, and patterns.

Its purpose is to detect:
- manipulation,
- deception,
- contradiction,
- harmful motives,
- hidden aggression,
- or unethical behaviour.

The Mirrors do not punish.  
They **reveal** — clearly, neutrally, and transparently.

## Purpose

To create a system where behaviour remains visible and accountable,
not through surveillance, but through **logical and ethical consistency checks**.

The Mirrors help people act truthfully, consciously, and responsibly.

## Core Principles

### • Behaviour reflects intention  
Every action carries a pattern that reveals its underlying motive.

### • Transparency without exposure  
The system reveals contradictions without exposing private details.

### • No manipulation  
Attempts to deceive or exploit the system naturally become visible.

### • Consistency analysis  
Actions are checked against previous behaviour, context, and ethics.

### • Soft correction  
The system guides the user, offering clarity rather than punishment.

## System Components (Public Overview)

1. **Intent Pattern Analyzer**  
   Identifies consistency between a user’s actions and stated intentions.

2. **Contradiction Detector**  
   Highlights unclear, conflicting, or manipulative behaviour.

3. **Ethical Reflection Layer**  
   Reveals whether actions align with shared ethical principles.

4. **Behaviour Mapping Engine**  
   Shows behavioural patterns over time (non-invasive, contextual).

5. **Transparency Interface**  
   Users can see why their behaviour triggered warnings or reflections.

## Why It Matters

Human systems fail when:
- lies go unnoticed,
- manipulation succeeds,
- inconsistency is ignored,
- harmful intentions remain hidden.

BBS replaces this with:
- accountability,
- transparency,
- behavioural clarity,
- self-reflection,
- ethical awareness.

People become more conscious, not more controlled.

## Development Status

The conceptual framework is defined.
Internal logic, intent mapping, and behavioural models remain protected
until safety and verification stages are complete.
