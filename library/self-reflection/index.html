Self-Reflection Engine — Internal Audit, Consistency, and Ethical Coherence

The Self-Reflection Engine is the inner examiner of BBS and LEO.
It is responsible for checking how the system thinks, what conclusions it makes,
and whether these conclusions remain consistent with the core ethical and logical principles.

Its purpose is not to control users, but to control the internal integrity of the system itself.

The Self-Reflection Engine helps ensure that reasoning remains:

consistent over time
resistant to hidden bias
aligned with core ethical principles
transparent and traceable
open to correction and improvement

Objectives

• Internal honesty
The system must be able to “look at itself” and detect contradictions, gaps, or dangerous drifts in logic.

• Bias awareness
Instead of pretending to be neutral, the engine actively searches for potential bias sources and flags them.

• Ethical coherence
Conclusions, recommendations, and risk assessments must remain compatible with the ethical core of BBS.

• Continuous improvement
Detected issues are not hidden — they are recorded, analysed, and used to improve future decisions.

• Traceable reasoning
Human reviewers must be able to see how key conclusions were reached and what doubts were identified internally.

Core Components (Public Overview)

Reasoning Consistency Checker
Analyses chains of arguments and decisions for logical conflicts, circular reasoning, or unexplained jumps.

Bias & Drift Monitor
Monitors patterns over time to detect slow drift away from ethical or logical baselines.

Ethical Coherence Validator
Checks whether decisions and recommendations remain compatible with BBS core principles and declared policies.

Self-Audit Log
Keeps an internal record of detected issues, doubts, conflicts, and corrections — with integrity protection.

Reflection Interface for Human Review
Allows authorized human reviewers to inspect internal doubts, tensions, and flagged risks.

Why It Matters

Without self-reflection, any complex system can:

repeat the same mistakes
silently accumulate bias
become overconfident and opaque
deviate from its declared principles

The Self-Reflection Engine provides a different approach:
it formalises internal doubt, careful self-checking, and transparent error handling
as essential parts of intelligence — not as weaknesses.

Development Status

The Self-Reflection Engine is conceptually defined and linked to:

LEO’s reasoning patterns
the Integrity Layer (for protected self-audit logs)
future oversight tools for human reviewers

Technical implementation of pattern analysis, bias monitoring, and consistency checks
will be developed gradually, together with the evolution of LEO and BBS governance mechanisms.
