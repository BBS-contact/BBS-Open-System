# BBS — Big Begins Small  
**An Ethical Open System for People**

We are building **BBS** — an open-source ethical framework where technology serves people, not corporations.  

Our goal is to restore trust, dignity, and transparency through open data, verifiable records, and human-centered AI.  

BBS is not a product — it is a framework of truth and cooperation.  
It unites modules of knowledge, law, health, ecology, and civic life into one transparent digital ecosystem.  

Everyone who believes that technology can still be honest is welcome to join.  
Developers, artists, writers, philosophers, civic innovators — all are part of this new foundation.
