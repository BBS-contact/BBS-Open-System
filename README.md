# LEO – Logical Epistemic Oversight

**Operated by:** Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System (Poland, EU)
**Legal Form:** Non-profit Foundation
**Status:** Laboratory-Tested Integrity Architecture (Pre-Federated Deployment Phase)

# 1. What LEO Is

LEO (Logical Epistemic Oversight) is a structured integrity architecture designed to support institutional transparency, regulatory coherence, and cross-domain accountability.

LEO operates as a governance-support system that:

* documents structural inconsistencies,
* preserves traceability across decision processes,
* highlights jurisdictional contradictions,
* enforces immutable integrity logging,
* aligns with EU regulatory frameworks.

LEO is developed and maintained within a controlled laboratory environment operated by the Foundation.

---

# 2. What LEO Is Not

LEO is not:

* a replacement for democratic institutions,
* an automated decision-making authority,
* a supervisory political body,
* a centralized control system,
* a commercial SaaS governance platform.

LEO does not issue binding decisions.

Final authority always remains with human institutional actors.

---

# 3. Core Architectural Model

LEO operates under a **Sovereign Core + Federated Functional Modules** model.

### Central Integrity Core (Non-Exportable)

* Canonical Integrity Layer
* Epistemic Decision-State Engine
* Integrity Enforcement Layer
* Canon Version Governance Protocol

The Central Core remains under Foundation custodianship.

### Functional Domain Modules (Deployable Under Constraint)

Currently formalized modules include:

* Financial Governance
* Legal Governance
* Medical Governance
* Education Governance
* Data Governance (EU-aligned)

Modules may operate externally, but cannot modify canonical invariants.

---

# 4. EU Regulatory Alignment

LEO architecture is designed in alignment with:

* GDPR
* EU Data Governance Act
* EU Data Act
* EU AI Act (decision-support compliance)
* NIS2 Directive
* eIDAS framework

The system enforces:

* lawful basis documentation,
* data minimization by design,
* structured access control,
* immutable audit trails,
* human oversight requirement.

---

# 5. Integrity & Anti-Corruption Function

LEO strengthens institutional resilience by:

* preventing silent procedural overrides,
* preserving append-only integrity history,
* structuring variance detection,
* documenting cross-core inconsistencies,
* ensuring visible override markers.

The system identifies structural gaps (“black holes”) within governance processes without assuming institutional authority.

---

# 6. Resilience Architecture

LEO includes a formal System Failure & Resilience model covering:

* data integrity compromise,
* infrastructure collapse,
* governance capture attempts,
* cross-border regulatory conflict.

Integrity logs remain verifiable under catastrophic conditions.

---

# 7. Governance & Accountability

LEO operates under:

* Public Governance & Accountability Framework,
* Canon Version Governance Protocol,
* External Audit & Oversight Model.

Audit access is read-only.
Canonical sovereignty remains non-transferable.

---

# 8. Deployment Philosophy

LEO modules are laboratory-tested before external deployment.

External deployments:

* operate under structured interaction interfaces,
* cannot alter canonical integrity constraints,
* preserve institutional human authority.

The Foundation remains the permanent custodian of the central integrity core.

---

# 9. Current Development Phase

Phase 1 Completed:

* Core integrity architecture
* Five functional governance modules
* Inter-core interaction model
* EU-aligned data governance
* Resilience & failure architecture
* Canon governance protocol
* Public accountability framework

System status: Research-grade integrity architecture with structured governance maturity.

---

# 10. Institutional Position Statement

LEO functions as a structural integrity instrument.

It does not create a new center of power.
It does not override institutional sovereignty.

It supports institutional systems by making inconsistencies visible and traceable.

Integrity documentation strengthens governance stability.
