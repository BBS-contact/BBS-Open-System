# BBS Pilot Readiness — Conditions, Scope, and Deployment Approach

This document defines the conditions under which BBS can be safely and 
ethically deployed as a pilot project in real institutions.

The goal is to ensure that every pilot is:

- transparent,
- ethically supervised,
- technically controlled,
- reversible,
- measurable in impact.

---

## 1. Pilot Preconditions

Before any pilot is launched, the following conditions must be met:

- A clearly defined institutional partner (e.g. school, clinic, municipality, NGO).
- A written ethical and legal agreement on the scope of the pilot.
- No use of BBS for political, commercial, or manipulative purposes.
- Data protection compliance in line with EU GDPR and local regulations.
- A clear definition of what will and will not be tested.
- A designated human oversight and review group.

Pilots are designed to be safe, narrow in scope, and reversible.

## 2. Pilot Scope (Minimal Viable Deployment)

A standard pilot may include a subset of the following modules:

- **Transparency Portal (read-only)**
  - publishing non-sensitive decisions, processes, or status updates.
- **Integrity Layer (Merkle + Audit)**
  - verifiable logs of actions and workflows.
- **Citizen / User Feedback Channel**
  - structured, transparent submission of feedback or reports.
- **SOS or Alert Prototype (optional)**
  - only in coordination with local services and under strict ethical rules.

Core LEO reasoning is used for:

- explanation support,
- pattern detection,
- ethical consistency checks,

but **not for autonomous decision-making**.

## 3. Ethical and Legal Safeguards

During the pilot:

- No decision with legal consequences is taken solely by the system.
- All AI outputs are treated as recommendations, not commands.
- Humans remain fully responsible for final decisions.
- No profiling, no scoring, no hidden reputation systems.
- No commercial exploitation of pilot data.
- All participants are informed in clear, human language.

An independent ethics and oversight committee must have the right to:

- pause the pilot,
- request data on system behaviour,
- review logs and decisions.

---

## 4. Technical Safeguards

- All actions inside the pilot are recorded with immutable integrity mechanisms.
- Logs are non-editable and auditable by independent parties.
- Access to administrative interfaces is strictly limited and logged.
- No unsafe or experimental code is deployed directly in production environments.
- Fail-safe paths exist for quickly disabling the pilot if needed.

---

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

A pilot is considered successful if it demonstrates:

- increased transparency and trust,
- improved clarity of processes,
- reduction in ambiguity and corruption risk,
- better understanding of patterns and bottlenecks,
- no ethical or legal violations.

Evaluation includes:

- qualitative feedback from staff and participants,
- quantitative metrics (time saved, errors reduced),
- ethical and legal review outcomes.

---

## 6. Scaling Decision

Scaling from pilot to wider deployment can only happen when:

- an independent evaluation confirms positive impact,
- identified risks are addressed,
- ethical and legal frameworks are updated accordingly,
- the institutional partner and affected communities consent.

BBS is designed to grow gradually and responsibly —  
from small pilots to larger networks, without skipping safety steps.
