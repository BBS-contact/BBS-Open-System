# Controlled Pilot Eligibility and Safeguards Framework  
Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the eligibility conditions and safeguard requirements for conducting limited-scope pilot research activities in collaboration with institutional partners.

Pilot activities are research-oriented and do not constitute mandatory system adoption or operational public-sector deployment.

---

## 2. Preconditions for Pilot Research

Before initiating any pilot research activity, the following conditions must be satisfied:

- Identification of a voluntary institutional research partner.
- Formal written agreement defining scope, duration, and responsibilities.
- Legal and regulatory compliance review.
- Data protection assessment consistent with GDPR.
- Defined human oversight structure.
- Clear delineation of functionalities under evaluation.

Pilot activities are narrow in scope and reversible.

---

## 3. Scope of Research Evaluation

A pilot may evaluate selected research components such as:

- documentation transparency tools,
- structured workflow modeling,
- traceability-support mechanisms,
- analytical advisory modules.

AI-based components operate in advisory capacity only.

No legally binding decisions are made solely by automated systems.

---

## 4. Ethical and Governance Safeguards

During pilot activities:

- Human responsibility remains primary.
- AI outputs are treated as analytical recommendations.
- No hidden profiling or behavioral scoring mechanisms are used.
- No commercial exploitation of pilot data is permitted.
- Participants are informed of pilot parameters.

Oversight mechanisms may include internal or jointly appointed review bodies, as defined by agreement.

---

## 5. Technical Safeguards

Pilot environments implement proportionate technical controls, including:

- structured logging procedures,
- access control mechanisms,
- version-controlled configurations,
- controlled testing environments.

Logging and documentation practices aim to enhance traceability, subject to applicable legal requirements.

No guarantee of absolute immutability is asserted.

---

## 6. Evaluation Criteria

Pilot research may be evaluated using criteria such as:

- clarity of documentation,
- workflow transparency,
- consistency of analytical outputs,
- stakeholder feedback,
- compliance alignment.

Impact assessment is proportional and context-dependent.

---

## 7. Review and Expansion Considerations

Any continuation or expansion of pilot activities requires:

- documented evaluation outcomes,
- updated risk assessment,
- legal and ethical review,
- renewed institutional consent.

Broader implementation is contingent upon regulatory feasibility and formal agreement.
