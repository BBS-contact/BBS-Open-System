# Information Security and Integrity Overview  
Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the information security and integrity principles applied within the research and development activities of Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System.

The framework supports compliance, traceability, and risk mitigation in alignment with European regulatory standards.

---

## 2. Security Principles

The Foundation follows the following security principles:

- Proportionate transparency
- Risk-based access control
- Documentation traceability
- Human oversight
- Continuous review

Security mechanisms are implemented through technical and organizational measures appropriate to the system’s risk profile.

No absolute guarantees of invulnerability are asserted.

---

## 3. Layered Security Approach

Security is structured across multiple layers, including:

- application-level access control,
- documented workflow traceability,
- logging and monitoring procedures,
- version-controlled configurations,
- controlled deployment environments.

Each layer is designed to reduce risk exposure and improve accountability.

---

## 4. Logging and Traceability

Where appropriate, system events may be:

- recorded in structured logs,
- timestamped,
- subject to integrity validation mechanisms.

Logging practices comply with applicable legal and data protection requirements.

Records are managed according to documented retention policies.

---

## 5. Access Control Model

Access is governed by:

- defined user roles,
- documented authorization rules,
- principle of least privilege,
- logging of administrative actions.

Access rights are subject to periodic review.

---

## 6. AI-Specific Safeguards

AI-related components operate under:

- advisory-only functionality,
- documented decision pathways,
- human oversight,
- compliance review procedures.

AI systems do not independently override safety constraints or assume legal authority.

---

## 7. Threat Awareness

The Foundation recognizes common digital risks, including:

- unauthorized access,
- data manipulation,
- misuse of administrative privileges,
- configuration errors,
- social engineering risks.

Mitigation strategies are proportionate and continuously reviewed.

---

## 8. Ongoing Security Review

Security practices are reviewed periodically in light of:

- regulatory developments,
- technical evolution,
- risk assessments,
- pilot feedback.

Adjustments are implemented as needed to maintain compliance and institutional integrity.
