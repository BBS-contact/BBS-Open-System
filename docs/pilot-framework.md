# Pilot Research Framework  
Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the structure, eligibility criteria, safeguards, and evaluation methodology for limited-scope pilot research activities conducted by Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System.

Pilot initiatives are research-oriented and do not constitute mandatory system adoption or public-sector deployment.

---

## 2. Preconditions for Pilot Research

Before initiating any pilot activity, the following conditions must be met:

- Identification of a voluntary institutional research partner.
- Formal written agreement defining scope, duration, and responsibilities.
- Legal and regulatory compliance review.
- Data protection assessment in accordance with GDPR.
- Defined human oversight structure.
- Clearly delimited functional scope under evaluation.

Pilot activities are proportionate and reversible.

---

## 3. Scope of Evaluation

Pilot projects may evaluate selected research components, such as:

- documentation transparency tools,
- workflow modeling frameworks,
- traceability-support mechanisms,
- advisory analytical modules.

AI systems operate strictly in an advisory capacity.

No legally binding decisions are made solely by automated systems.

---

## 4. Technical and Organizational Safeguards

Pilot environments implement proportionate safeguards, including:

- structured logging procedures,
- role-based access control,
- documented configuration management,
- controlled testing environments,
- version tracking of evaluated components.

No guarantees of absolute immutability or invulnerability are asserted.

---

## 5. Ethical and Governance Oversight

During pilot activities:

- Human responsibility remains primary.
- AI outputs are treated as analytical recommendations.
- No hidden profiling or behavioral scoring is applied.
- No commercial exploitation of pilot data is permitted.
- Participants are informed of pilot parameters.

Oversight mechanisms are defined within formal cooperation agreements.

---

## 6. Evaluation Criteria

Pilot outcomes may be assessed using:

- documentation completeness,
- workflow clarity,
- traceability of analytical steps,
- compliance alignment,
- stakeholder feedback,
- proportional risk assessment.

Impact is context-dependent and not presumed.

---

## 7. Review and Continuation

Any continuation or expansion of pilot activities requires:

- documented evaluation results,
- updated risk assessment,
- renewed legal review,
- formal institutional agreement.

Broader application remains contingent upon regulatory feasibility.
