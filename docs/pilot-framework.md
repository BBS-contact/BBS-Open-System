# Pilot Research Evaluation Framework  
Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the framework for limited-scope pilot research activities conducted by Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System in collaboration with partner institutions.

Pilot activities are exploratory and research-oriented. They do not constitute mandatory system adoption or public-sector deployment.

---

## 2. Phase I — Preparation

- Define pilot research objectives and scope.
- Identify participating institutions or research partners.
- Conduct legal and compliance assessment.
- Define data protection and governance safeguards.
- Establish evaluation criteria and documentation standards.

Participation is voluntary and governed by formal agreements.

---

## 3. Phase II — Controlled Activation

During pilot testing, selected research components may be evaluated, such as:

- documentation and transparency-support tools,
- structured audit and traceability mechanisms,
- analytical advisory modules,
- workflow modeling frameworks.

Components are implemented in controlled and proportionate environments.

No autonomous decision-making authority is delegated to AI systems.

---

## 4. Phase III — Evaluation

Pilot outcomes may be assessed using criteria such as:

- documentation completeness,
- traceability of analytical steps,
- workflow clarity,
- procedural consistency,
- regulatory alignment,
- stakeholder feedback.

Impact is evaluated proportionately and without presumption of guaranteed outcomes.

---

## 5. Phase IV — Review and Scaling Considerations

Following evaluation:

- continuation or expansion may be considered,
- additional compliance review may be required,
- risk assessment is updated,
- institutional readiness is re-evaluated.

Any broader application is subject to legal feasibility, regulatory compliance, and institutional agreement.

---

## 6. Governance and Safeguards

All pilot activities operate under:

- Polish foundation law,
- GDPR requirements,
- AI Governance Policy,
- internal ethical and risk review procedures.

Pilot research is conducted transparently and proportionately.
