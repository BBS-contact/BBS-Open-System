# Letter to the President of the European Commission  
## Proposal for Strategic Collaboration on Ethical Digital Infrastructure and Public Trust

President Ursula von der Leyen  
European Commission  
Rue de la Loi 200  
1049 Brussels, Belgium

Madam President,

We respectfully submit this letter to introduce **BBS (Big Begins Small)** — a European-born model of ethical, transparent, and tamper-proof digital infrastructure. It is designed to strengthen public trust, support institutional integrity, and complement the European Union’s long-term vision for secure, human-centered digital transformation.

BBS is not a commercial product and not a private-sector platform.  
It is a structural framework intended for **public benefit**, built upon principles of truth, transparency, responsibility, and human dignity.  

Our objective is not financial support.  
Our request is **institutional dialogue and evaluation**.

---

## Purpose of This Communication

We propose a formal discussion between the European Commission and the BBS team to explore:

1. **Scientific and ethical evaluation** of the BBS architecture by STOA and the JRC.  
2. **A controlled institutional pilot**, co-developed within an EU framework.  
3. **Assessment of BBS as a strategic model** for transparent governance and ethical AI.  
4. **Long-term collaboration** on digital integrity and public trust.

The initiative aligns directly with the Commission’s priority areas:

- trustworthy AI and the AI Act  
- digital transformation of public administration  
- transparency & integrity mechanisms  
- cross-border digital cooperation  
- European democracy and resilience  
- safeguarding of fundamental rights

## Why BBS Is Relevant for Europe

Europe is building the most advanced ethical and regulatory foundations in the world.  
Yet institutions still face challenges that cannot be solved through regulation alone:

- declining public trust  
- fragmented digital architectures  
- insufficient transparency of internal processes  
- rising complexity of automated decisions  
- vulnerability to corruption and manipulation  
- limited cross-border interoperability  

BBS addresses these issues through:

- **tamper-proof integrity layers** (Merkle verification, multi-channel audit)  
- **transparent public logic** for decisions and data flows  
- **ethical AI reasoning** that is fully explainable  
- **responsibility-based access models**  
- **no backdoors, no privileged accounts, no hidden controls**  
- **modular societal architecture** supporting institutions, citizens, and cross-border cooperation  

It offers a constitutional-level approach to digital trust —  
a foundation that Europe can lead the world in shaping.

## Proposal for Next Steps

We respectfully recommend the following process:

### Phase 1 — Evaluation  
Independent review by:
- STOA (European Parliament)  
- JRC AI & Society Unit  

### Phase 2 — Pilot  
A controlled institutional pilot in cooperation with:
- a municipality,  
- a public service,  
- or a transparency-oriented body.  

### Phase 3 — Strategic Assessment  
Exploration of BBS as a structural model for:
- public-sector transparency  
- ethical AI deployment  
- digital sovereignty  
- cross-border verification  

We seek guidance on how best to engage with the appropriate Commission units  
to ensure proper evaluation and alignment with European policy frameworks.

## Closing Statement

Madam President,  
Europe has the opportunity to establish a new global standard:  
a digital infrastructure that is transparent, ethical, verifiable, and fundamentally human-centered.

BBS is offered not as a technology transfer, but as a **partnership** —  
to build systems that empower citizens, strengthen institutions, and secure the digital future.

We would be honoured to begin a formal dialogue  
and provide any technical, ethical, or operational documentation required.

Respectfully submitted,  
**BBS Contact Team**
