# BBS Pilot Protocol  
## Framework for a Controlled, Safe, and Transparent Institutional Pilot  
### Public-Facing Evaluation Document for the European Commission

---

## 1. Purpose of the Pilot

The pilot aims to evaluate BBS as a structural model for:

- digital integrity  
- transparent governance  
- ethical AI support  
- verifiable institutional decision processes  
- tamper-proof audit and reporting  

The objective is **not deployment**, but **controlled evaluation** within a limited institutional environment.

The pilot introduces only **non-invasive**, **non-destructive**, and **fully reversible** components.

---

## 2. Pilot Principles

The pilot is governed by five core principles:

### 1. Safety  
No action can override existing institutional systems or authority.

### 2. Transparency  
All pilot operations are traceable and explainable.

### 3. Non-interference  
BBS operates as a parallel observation and verification layer.

### 4. Ethical Operation  
The pilot follows the BBS Ethics Framework and EU AI Act requirements.

### 5. Full Reversibility  
Pilot components can be cleanly removed without affecting institutional data or processes.

## 3. Pilot Scope (What Is Included)

The following components are activated in the pilot:

### 3.1 Integrity Layer (Restricted Mode)
- Merkle validation  
- integrity snapshots  
- audit stream mapping  
- non-sensitive timeline reconstruction  

No internal algorithms or salts are exposed.

### 3.2 Transparency Layer (Public-Facing)
- high-level transparency panel  
- verifiable integrity proofs  
- public explanations of system behaviour  

No personal data is processed or displayed.

### 3.3 LEO (Explainability-Only Mode)
Included:
- context interpretation  
- contradiction detection  
- ethical filtering  
- transparent explanations  

Excluded:
- autonomous decision-making  
- advanced memory functions  
- internal reasoning engines  

### 3.4 Platform Modules (Minimal Set)
A limited selection of modules may be evaluated:

- Transparency  
- Integrity  
- Public Information Interface  
- SOS/Reporting prototype (optional)  

These modules run in isolated, non-operational demonstration mode.

---

## 4. Pilot Exclusions (What Is Not Included)

The pilot **does not** include:

- access to institutional databases  
- identity management or login systems  
- modification of internal records  
- backend replacement of institutional systems  
- sensitive AI reasoning components  
- national-scale integration  

The pilot cannot alter, replace, or influence institutional decisions.

---

## 5. Technical Environment Requirements

### 5.1 Deployment Mode
- isolated virtual environment  
- no backend write-access  
- read-only observational connectors (if approved)  
- encrypted log storage  

### 5.2 Data Protection
- GDPR-compliant configuration  
- no personal data ingestion  
- no persistent tracking  
- no cross-system data exchange  

### 5.3 Security Requirements
- hashed-only verification paths  
- isolated temporal storage  
- reversible deployment  

---

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

### 6.1 Technical Metrics
- integrity validation accuracy  
- transparency panel clarity  
- explainability output consistency  
- anomaly detection stability  

### 6.2 Institutional Metrics
- ease of adoption  
- interpretability by staff  
- improvement in transparency  
- reduction of ambiguity in decision-making processes  

### 6.3 Ethical and Safety Metrics
- compliance with ethical guidelines  
- absence of manipulation or influence  
- proper boundary adherence  

---

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

### BBS Team
- provides system components  
- ensures safe operation  
- supports evaluation  
- monitors boundary adherence  

### Host Institution
- defines the operational environment  
- provides non-sensitive example data (optional)  
- participates in observation  
- evaluates results  

### European Commission (if applicable)
- supervises pilot structure  
- validates safety and compliance  
- coordinates scientific evaluation  

---

## 8. Pilot Timeline (Proposed)

Phase 1 — Technical preparation: 4–6 weeks  
Phase 2 — Controlled activation: 8–12 weeks  
Phase 3 — Evaluation period: 4–6 weeks  
Phase 4 — Reporting and recommendations: 4 weeks  

Total estimated pilot duration: **20–28 weeks**.

---

## 9. Outputs of the Pilot

At the conclusion of the pilot, the following deliverables will be produced:

- technical performance report  
- ethical compliance review  
- transparency & interpretability analysis  
- institutional feedback summary  
- recommendations for scaling or modification  

---

## 10. Conclusion

The BBS Pilot Protocol ensures that all evaluation activities are:

- safe  
- controlled  
- ethical  
- transparent  
- reversible  

This provides a responsible foundation for assessing BBS as a potential structural component in future European digital governance strategies.
