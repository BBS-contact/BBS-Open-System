## 1. Purpose of the Criteria

This document defines the conditions under which an EU institution or public authority can be considered a suitable pilot site for the controlled evaluation of BBS (Big Begins Small).

The purpose is to ensure that any pilot:

- operates safely,  
- respects institutional autonomy,  
- avoids disruption,  
- provides meaningful evaluation data,  
- aligns with EU policy objectives.

## 2. Eligibility Requirements for Pilot Institutions

An institution can be considered for a BBS pilot if it meets the following criteria:

### 2.1 Structural Readiness
The institution must:

- operate with clear procedural workflows,  
- maintain internal digital systems (any type),  
- be able to allocate a technical or administrative liaison team.

### 2.2 Non-Critical Operational Environment
The institution must not be engaged in:

- military operations,  
- high-risk financial markets,  
- classified cybersecurity systems,  
- national security processes.

The pilot must not interfere with critical national infrastructure.

### 2.3 Commitment to Transparency and Ethics
The institution must demonstrate:

- willingness to engage in transparency improvements,  
- openness to explainable AI,  
- willingness to publish certain non-sensitive outcomes,  
- adherence to EU ethical and legal frameworks.

### 2.4 Legal and Administrative Compliance
The institution must be able to:

- comply with GDPR during the pilot,  
- ensure no personal data is transferred to BBS,  
- provide a legal contact for compliance matters.

## 3. Technical Environment Requirements

### 3.1 Controlled Sandbox or Virtual Layer
The pilot must be deployed in:

- a sandbox environment,  
- a virtual machine,  
- or an isolated test server.

No access to production systems is required.

### 3.2 Reversible Deployment
The institution must allow:

- clean installation,  
- clean removal without system interference,  
- no long-term footprint.

### 3.3 Observation-Only Mode
Institutional systems remain untouched.  
BBS operates as a **parallel, observational layer**.

## 4. Administrative Requirements

### 4.1 Institutional Liaison Team
A pilot candidate must designate:

- one technical liaison,  
- one administrative liaison,  
- one ethics or legal observer (if available).

### 4.2 Documentation Collaboration
The institution agrees to:

- participate in interviews,  
- provide anonymized process descriptions,  
- support transparency evaluation.

### 4.3 Pilot Evaluation Participation
The institution must commit to:

- completing evaluation forms,  
- participating in feedback sessions,  
- reviewing pilot impact reports.

## 5. Recommended Pilot Categories

Based on preliminary analysis, the following types of institutions are most suitable:

### 5.1 Municipal Authorities
Ideal for evaluating transparency improvements and public-facing services.

### 5.2 Public Health Administration Units
Suitable for analyzing procedural clarity and integrity layers.

### 5.3 Education and Research Authorities
Suitable for structured process analysis and explainable AI.

### 5.4 Public Service Coordination Offices

- ministries of defence,  
- intelligence agencies,  
- classified cybersecurity centres,

- high-frequency financial institutions.

---

## 7. Selection Process for EU Institutions

The proposed selection process:

1. Initial eligibility screening  
2. Administrative and ethical compliance review  
3. Technical environment validation  
4. Meeting between BBS team and institutional representatives  
5. Approval from relevant EU directorates  
6. Formal designation of pilot site  

This ensures transparency, safety, and responsible deployment.

---

## 8. Conclusion

These criteria offer the European Commission a clear and structured framework for identifying the most suitable environment for the BBS pilot.

They support:

- risk minimization,  
- ethical deployment,  
- transparency,  
- institutional accountability,  
- meaningful scientific evaluation.
