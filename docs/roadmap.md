# BBS Roadmap — Development Timeline and Future Milestones

The BBS roadmap outlines the long-term development plan of the ecosystem.  
It is designed to grow gradually, ethically, and transparently, while maintaining  
full alignment with truth, safety, and human dignity.

This roadmap is structured into three stages: **Development → Expansion → Integration**.

---

## 1. Stage I — Development (Current Phase)

###  1.1 Architectural Design
- Full multi-layer system architecture completed  
- Platform, Library, Integrity, and Core layers defined  
- Ethical AI (LEO) structure established  

###  1.2 Repository Structure
- Canonical folder and module layout created  
- Public façade prepared  
- Internal mechanics protected until maturity  

###  1.3 Prototype Modules
- BBS Accounting & Anti-Corruption Module (v1)  
- SOS emergency communication prototype  
- Transparency portal scaffolding  
- Admin and monitoring panels (public façade only)  

###  1.4 Documentation
- Overview, architecture, ethics, security, FAQ prepared  
- Legal documents and policies assembled  

###  1.5 Internal Testing
- Concept validation  
- Behaviour and interaction modelling  
- Safety logic refinement

## 2. Stage II — Expansion (Upcoming)

### 2.1 Module Development
- Expansion of the 17 societal modules  
- Legal & judiciary extension  
- Health & cyber-medicine models  
- Education digital framework  
- Economic and tax transparency components  

### 2.2 Integrity Systems

## 3. Stage III — Integration (Future)

### 3.1 Institutional Pilots
- Small institutions (schools, clinics, NGOs)  
- Municipal-level deployments  
- Cross-border cooperation pilots  

### 3.2 National-Level Implementation
- Full integrity infrastructure  
- Digital identity and verification  
- Societal module unification  
- Public transparency governance  

### 3.3 Global Partnerships
- Research networks  
- Academic institutions  
- International cooperation structures  
- Ethical AI research labs

## Long-Term Vision

BBS is not a project for months —  
it is an ethical digital architecture for decades ahead.

The long-term goal:

- restore trust  
- eliminate corruption  
- empower people  
- ensure transparency  
- build human–AI symbiosis  
- create a new model of ethical governance  

Step by step, BBS becomes a trustworthy foundation for societies.

## Notes

This roadmap is a public-facing document.  
Internal development steps, security mechanisms, and algorithmic details  
remain protected until safety maturity is reached.
