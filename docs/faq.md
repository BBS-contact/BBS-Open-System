# 1. What is BBS?

BBS (Big Begins Small) is an ethical, transparent, and modular
digital ecosystem designed to restore trust, integrity, and clarity
in modern societies.

It combines:

- modular societal functions,  
- ethical AI (LEO),  
- immutable audit trails,  
- secure digital identity,  
- open knowledge systems,  
- transparent decision logic.

BBS is not a government service, not a product, and not a private platform.
It is a structural model of truth and cooperation.

# 2. Why was BBS created?

Societies today suffer from:

- hidden corruption,  
- unreliable data,  
- fragmented services,  
- bureaucratic waste,  
- manipulation,  
- lack of accountability.

BBS solves these problems with transparency, ethical AI,
and verifiable processes.

# 3. Who owns BBS?

No one.  
BBS does not belong to a corporation or government.

It belongs to the people who build it —
researchers, developers, auditors, designers, and civic innovators.

# 4. What is LEO?

LEO is the ethical AI core of BBS.
It is responsible for:

- reasoning,  
- context,  
- truth alignment,  
- ethical filtering,  
- memory,  
- stability,  
- support for decision-making.

LEO does not control people.  
It supports them ethically and transparently.

# 6. Is BBS safe?

Yes.  
Security is based on:

- Merkle verification  
- multi-channel audit  
- immutable logs  
- behaviour-based access  
- ethical AI constraints  
- distributed trust  
- no superusers  
- no hidden powers

The system cannot be silently corrupted.

# 7. Can BBS be used by governments?

Yes — but under strict conditions:

- full transparency  
- no political influence  
- no hidden manipulation  
- ethical oversight  
- independent verification

BBS is a public infrastructure, not a political tool.

BBS welcomes:

- developers

- ethicists  
- lawyers  
- educators  
- medics  
- designers  
- volunteers

Participation is open and transparent.

# 9. What stage is BBS currently in?

BBS is in:

- architectural design  
- prototype development  
- internal testing  
- documentation building  
- partner outreach  
- early research collaboration  

Core concepts are public; internal mechanics remain protected
until safety and maturity are confirmed.

# 10. How does BBS handle data?

With strict ethical rules:

- no unnecessary data collection  
- full transparency  
- immutable records

BBS scales gradually:

- small institutions → cities → regions → nations → global networks  
- each module can operate independently  
- integrity systems ensure consistency during scaling
