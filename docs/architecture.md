# Research System Architecture Overview  
Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a high-level overview of the research-oriented digital architecture developed and evaluated within Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System.

The architecture supports analytical, governance, and transparency-oriented research activities in alignment with the Foundation’s statutory objectives.

This overview is informational and does not disclose protected intellectual property or internal security mechanisms.

## 2. Layered Architecture Model

The system architecture follows a layered design approach to ensure modularity, transparency, and controlled evolution.

### 2.1 Application Layer

This layer includes functional research domains such as:

- AI and analytical tools
- Governance modeling
- Transparency frameworks
- Grant and partnership support modules
- Educational and knowledge resources

Each functional domain operates as an independent module while maintaining structured interoperability through defined interfaces.

---

### 2.2 Knowledge and Data Layer

This layer supports:

- structured knowledge repositories,
- documentation systems,
- version-controlled datasets,
- research artifacts and metadata management.

Data flows are governed by documented access rules and data protection standards.

---

### 2.3 Integrity and Verification Layer

To enhance transparency and traceability, the architecture may incorporate:

- version control mechanisms,
- audit logging procedures,
- cryptographic verification tools (where appropriate),
- structured accountability documentation.

These mechanisms aim to support reproducibility, integrity validation, and institutional trust.

---

### 2.4 Analytical Core (LEO System)

The LEO system functions as an analytical and advisory core within the research framework.

Its components support:

- structured reasoning processes,
- contextual data continuity,
- internal consistency validation,
- risk-aware analytical modeling.

LEO operates in an advisory capacity and does not replace human decision-making authority.

---

## 3. Design Principles

The architecture is guided by the following principles:

- **Modularity:** Independent components can evolve without destabilizing the overall system.
- **Interoperability:** Standardized interfaces enable structured communication between modules.
- **Transparency:** Documentation and versioning support traceability.
- **Security:** Access control and risk mitigation mechanisms are applied proportionately.
- **Scalability:** The framework is adaptable to institutional and research-scale contexts.

---

## 4. Public Technical Overview

At a general level, the architecture may include:

- modular backend services,
- structured API communication layers,
- documentation-based audit trails,
- controlled data processing pipelines,
- research-grade validation workflows.

Specific algorithms, cryptographic implementations, and internal logic remain protected as intellectual property.

---

## 5. Governance Integration

The architectural framework operates in conjunction with:

- the AI Governance Policy,
- the Privacy Policy,
- the Data Retention Policy,
- internal compliance procedures.

Technical development is reviewed periodically to maintain regulatory alignment and operational coherence.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The architecture provides a structured research environment for developing and evaluating governance-support technologies in a transparent and accountable manner.

It is designed as an evolving institutional framework rather than a fixed or absolute system.
