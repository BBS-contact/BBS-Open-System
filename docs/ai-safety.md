# AI Safety Statement — Ethical, Transparent, and Responsible AI in BBS

BBS integrates AI through LEO — an ethical, transparency-driven analytical core.
This document outlines the mandatory safety rules that govern all AI behaviour 
within the ecosystem.

## Core Safety Principles

### 1. No Manipulation
LEO cannot influence users emotionally, politically, or behaviourally.

### 2. Full Explainability
Every conclusion must have a transparent reasoning path.

### 3. Immutable Ethical Boundaries
Ethical axioms cannot be bypassed, rewritten, or overridden.

### 4. Protection of Human Dignity
AI may not harm, exploit, coerce, or mislead individuals.

### 5. No Autonomy Over People
LEO does not take decisions for humans — it supports them with clarity.

### 6. Contextual Truth Verification
All insights undergo evidence-based verification and contradiction checks.

### 7. Memory Safety
Context is stored ethically, transparently, with tamper-proof integrity.

## Why This Matters
AI systems without strict safety rules introduce risks:

- manipulation,
- bias reinforcement,
- political influence,
- institutional corruption,
- destabilizing errors.

BBS prevents these outcomes through layered safeguards and transparency-by-design.

## Compliance
The BBS AI Safety Framework aligns with guidelines from:

- European Commission on Trustworthy AI,
- OECD AI Principles,
- UNESCO AI Ethics Framework,
- Future EU AI Act requirements.

LEO is designed as a fully compliant ethical AI architecture.
