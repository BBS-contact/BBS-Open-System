# BBS Pilot Proposal
## Ethical, Transparent, and Verifiable Digital Infrastructure for Institutional Deployment

This document presents the proposed structure for a safe, evidence-based pilot implementation of BBS in collaboration with EU institutions.

Its purpose is to demonstrate:
- feasibility,
- public value,
- safety,
- compliance,
- and long-term European alignment.

The proposal follows EU guidelines for experimental digital governance systems.

# 1. Pilot Objectives

The pilot aims to validate BBS as a transparent, tamper-proof, and ethically governed digital infrastructure.

Key objectives:

• demonstrate verifiable transparency  
• validate integrity layers (Merkle, audit, timelines)  
• evaluate LEO’s safety and explainability  
• test cross-module communication  
• measure public-sector applicability  
• ensure GDPR and AI Act compliance  
• confirm operational robustness  

This is a **low-risk, high-value** institutional pilot.

# 2. Scope of the Pilot

The pilot focuses on three controlled domains:

## 2.1 Emergency Coordination (SOS Prototype)
- secure communication between actors  
- integrity-protected event logs  
- tamper-proof timeline of actions  
- transparent accountability without exposing private data  

Validated outcome:
A reliable, verifiable emergency communication protocol.

---

## 2.2 Transparency & Integrity Infrastructure
- immutable audit chains  
- public verification portals  
- cross-checked Merkle proofs  
- institutional log integrity  
- anti-corruption backbone testing  

Validated outcome:
Proof that corruption becomes detectible and impossible to hide.

---

## 2.3 Ethical AI Support Layer (LEO)
- explainable reasoning  
- contradiction detection  
- contextual guidance  
- ethical filtering  
- manipulation resistance  

Validated outcome:
Safe, non-autonomous AI that enhances clarity without replacing human judgement.

---

# 3. Pilot Architecture

The pilot runs on a hybrid architecture:

• isolated testbed servers  
• integrity replication nodes  
• transparent dashboards  
• institutional sandbox for verification  
• controlled public-access components (optional)  

No sensitive citizen data is collected.  
All information is synthetic or anonymised.

---

# 4. Evaluation Metrics

The pilot success criteria include:

## 4.1 Technical
- consistency of integrity proofs  
- failure resilience  
- latency and throughput  
- correctness of audit trails  
- absence of silent modifications  

## 4.2 Ethical
- explainability of AI reasoning  
- compliance with GDPR  
- transparency of decision chains  
- absence of manipulative patterns  

## 4.3 Operational
- ease of integration  
- clarity of system feedback  
- institutional usability tests

# 5. Risk Management & Safety Controls

BBS incorporates multi-layer safeguards:

• no superuser accounts  
• ethical access control  
• non-destructive logic  
• immutable logs  
• isolation of AI reasoning layers  
• strict data boundaries  
• sandbox environment  
• fallback integrity channels  

Risk level:
**Very Low**, due to isolation, immutability, and absence of sensitive data.

---

# 6. Alignment with EU Policies

The pilot aligns with:

• EU AI Act principles (transparency, human oversight, safety)  
• GDPR (data minimisation, privacy protection)  
• eIDAS (identity interoperability potential)  
• Digital Europe programme  
• European Strategy for Data  

---

# 7. Timeline

### Phase 1 — Preparation (4–6 weeks)
- server environment  
- integrity nodes  
- synthetic datasets  
- test scenarios  

### Phase 2 — Controlled Deployment (6–10 weeks)
- emergency coordination flows  
- transparency portals  
- audit verification  
- integrity stress tests  

### Phase 3 — Evaluation (4 weeks)
- JRC assessment  
- AI Office review  
- STOA report  
- recommendations for scaling  

Total: **14–20 weeks** depending on institution availability.

---

# 8. Roles & Responsibilities

• BBS team — architecture, implementation, technical support  
• EU partner institution — operational validation, compliance review  
• Independent observers — transparency and integrity assessment  

No privileged control is given to any actor.

---

# 9. Expected Outcomes

The pilot will deliver:

• proof of functional integrity backbone  
• validated emergency coordination model  
• safe AI reasoning module  
• compliance evidence  
• recommendations for EU-wide adaptation  
• a blueprint for national deployments  

This positions BBS as a potential **European Standard Infrastructure**.

---

# 10. Request for Collaboration

We seek:
- institutional evaluation,
- structured testing partnership,
- and participation of JRC + DG CNECT.

We do *not* request funding at this stage.

This is an invitation to explore a next-generation EU transparency model.
