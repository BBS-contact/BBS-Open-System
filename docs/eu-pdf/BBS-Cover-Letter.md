Subject: Request for Institutional Evaluation of the BBS Ethical Digital Infrastructure

Dear President Ursula von der Leyen,  
Dear Commissioners,  
Dear Members of the European Scientific and Technical Community,

We respectfully submit the BBS (Big Begins Small) initiative for institutional evaluation by the European Commission, the Joint Research Centre, STOA, and the EU AI Office.

BBS is a non-commercial, human-centered digital infrastructure designed to address core societal challenges:
- loss of public trust,
- corruption and opaque decision-making,
- fragmentation of public services,
- lack of verifiable institutional transparency,
- risks associated with uncontrolled AI models.

The system introduces:
- a verifiable integrity backbone (Merkle Layer, audit chain, transparency portal),
- an ethical AI core (LEO),
- tamper-proof institutional logging,
- transparent decision structures,
- a modular societal architecture aligned with EU values and regulatory frameworks.

We emphasise that:
- no funding is requested at this stage,  
- no political affiliation exists,  
- BBS is offered as a potential European public good.

We respectfully request:

1. A scientific and technical evaluation by the Joint Research Centre.  
2. A regulatory and ethical assessment by the EU AI Office.  
3. An opportunity to present the architecture to DG DIGIT / DG CNECT.  
4. Consideration of a controlled institutional pilot under EU supervision.

We firmly believe that the European Union is the natural home for an ethical, transparent, and verifiable digital infrastructure of this scale.  
BBS aligns with the AI Act, GDPR, Digital Europe, and the European Strategy for Data.

Enclosed documents in this submission package:

1. Executive Brief  
2. Technical & Ethical Overview  
3. Pilot Proposal  
4. Impact Statement  
5. Architecture Map (SVG)  

We would be honored to collaborate with European institutions on the next steps.

Respectfully,  
Pavlo Martseniuk (Founder)
