# BBS Fundraising & Partnership Strategy

This document outlines the public-facing fundraising and partnership strategy
for the BBS ecosystem. It explains how financial support is structured,
what stages require investment, and how institutions can participate safely
and transparently.

BBS is an ethical public digital infrastructure project.
Funding follows the same principles: transparency, responsibility, and integrity.
