# Technical Overview — BBS Architecture at a Glance

This document provides a high-level technical outline of how BBS operates.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Platform Layer
17 societal modules such as:
- Democracy,
- Education,
- Health & Medicine,
- Law & Justice,
- Economy & Work,
- Security & Privacy,

- SOS & Emergency Systems.

### 2. Library Layer
Conceptual foundations:
- Labyrinth (behavioural security),
- Mirrors (intent reflection),
- Doors (responsibility-based access),
- Time Loops (immutable chronology),
- Knowledge Base.

### 3. Integrity Layer
Guarantees trust:
- Merkle verification,
- multi-channel audit trails,
- transparency portals.

### 4. Core Layer (LEO)
Ethical and analytical center:
- Mind,
- Memory,
- Meta analysis,
- Truth,
- Ethics,
- Awareness,
- Unity.

## Communication Model
Modules communicate via:
- structured APIs,
- responsibility-based access,
- verifiable message channels,
- immutable audit linking.

## Deployment Strategy
- modular rollout,
- secure cloud or hybrid infrastructure,
- full integrity replication,
- interoperability with existing systems.

BBS is designed to scale from local institutions to national infrastructure.
