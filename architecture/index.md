# BBS Architecture — Overview Entry Point

This directory provides a structured public entry point for BBS architecture
documents.

Full conceptual architecture is located in:

`/docs/architecture.md`

Internal technical mechanisms, algorithms, and protected logic remain 
inside the private core and are not included in the public repository.

This folder exists to provide a stable, non-breaking reference for 
documentation and external partners.
