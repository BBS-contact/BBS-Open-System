# Verification Rules — Ethical Enforcement Engine

The Verification Rules module defines the ethical, structural,  
and logical constraints used across the BBS Integrity Layer.

It establishes the principles that govern:

- what actions are allowed or disallowed,  
- how verification decisions must be formed,  
- how conflicts and anomalies are evaluated,  
- what conditions define manipulation or corruption,  
- how integrity checks remain consistent and fair.

This module connects Merkle validation, audit trails,  
and transparency mechanisms into one unified ethical framework.

It ensures that all verification follows:

- truth-based logic,  
- accountability,  
- ethical neutrality,  
- immutable consistency.

## Purpose

To provide a clear rule-based foundation for all BBS integrity processes  
without exposing internal algorithms or sensitive logic.

These rules serve as the moral and structural backbone for  
how verification is performed inside the system.

## Development Status

The Verification Rules Engine is part of the upcoming expansion  
of the BBS Integrity Layer.

A detailed public specification will be released as the system reaches  
the required safety and maturity thresholds.
