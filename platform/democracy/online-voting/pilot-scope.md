# Pilot Scope — What We Actually Build First

This module is designed for national-scale use, but development must proceed step by step.

This pilot document defines what is realistic and measurable in an initial deployment.

---

## Pilot Goals (Realistic)

- run a controlled public consultation vote (non-binding or limited scope)
- demonstrate end-to-end integrity anchoring (Merkle proofs)
- demonstrate immutable audit trail for critical events
- publish a public election snapshot with verifiable proofs
- test identity binding with a chosen national eID environment (country-specific)

---

## What the Pilot Does Not Claim

- it does not claim immediate replacement of national elections
- it does not claim “perfect security”
- it does not claim that legal adoption is automatic
- it does not bypass constitutional or electoral law

---

## Pilot Outputs

- public results statement
- integrity proof package
- audit summary package
- documented incident response procedure
- recommendations for legal and technical scaling

---

## Why This Matters

A verified pilot proves that:
- the architecture is implementable,
- integrity is measurable,
- trust does not rely on election commissions,
- transparency can exist without violating privacy.
