# LEO — Ethical AI Core (Public Overview)

LEO is the ethical, analytical, and consistency-driving core of the BBS ecosystem.

This page provides a public, high-level overview of LEO’s role within the
Platform Layer.  
Technical implementation, internal reasoning models, and protected logic
are located in the Core Layer:

`/core/leo`

## Purpose
• Provide ethical, transparent decision support  
• Maintain reasoning consistency across modules  
• Ensure truth alignment and manipulation resistance  
• Support users through clear, accountable explanations  

## Why This Page Exists
The Platform Layer requires a public reference to LEO, since all modules
interact with the ethical AI core.

This directory serves as a documentation placeholder and does not contain
internal mechanisms.

Internal algorithms are protected and not part of the public repository.
