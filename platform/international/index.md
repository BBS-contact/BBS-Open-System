# International Cooperation — Transparent, Ethical Global Collaboration

The International Cooperation module defines how BBS interacts with countries,
institutions, global partners, and international organizations in a transparent,
neutral, and ethical manner.

Its purpose is to create systems of cooperation free from corruption,
political pressure, and hidden influence.

Global cooperation today is often shaped by political pressure,
conflicts of interest, and corruption.

BBS introduces a system where international collaboration is:

This strengthens peace, stability, and trust between nations.
