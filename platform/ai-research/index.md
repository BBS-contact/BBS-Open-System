# AI Research & Development — Public Collaboration Framework

The AI Research module represents the public, collaborative interface 
for research, experimentation, and academic partnerships within the BBS 
ecosystem.

This module does not contain internal LEO mechanisms.  
Core AI frameworks, reasoning logic, and protected algorithms remain 
inside the Core Layer (`/core/`).

## Purpose
• Support ethical AI research  
• Enable cooperation with universities and laboratories  
• Provide a safe conceptual environment for AI development  
• Facilitate public and academic studies on transparency, alignment, 
  and human–AI interaction  
• Promote responsible innovation

## Public Scope
This module exists to provide a structured entry point for research 
partners and grant organizations.

It will include:
- conceptual research guidelines,
- collaboration frameworks,
- non-sensitive AI tools,
- educational materials,
- transparency documentation.

## Why This Page Exists
References to AI Research appear throughout the BBS documentation.  
This directory prevents broken links and clarifies the role of AI research 
in the public ecosystem, while protecting internal logic.

Full implementation will evolve as cooperation with partners and 
institutions expands.
