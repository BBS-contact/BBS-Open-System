# Health & Medicine — Ethical, Transparent, and People-Centered Healthcare

The Health & Medicine module of BBS establishes a transparent,
evidence-based, and corruption-resistant healthcare framework.

Its purpose is to protect human life, ensure fairness,
and remove hidden corporate or political influence from medical decisions.
