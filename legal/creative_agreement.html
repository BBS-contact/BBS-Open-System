        <h1>Creative Freedom Agreement</h1>
        <p class="muted">
          This Agreement defines the terms under which authors publish their works
          on the BBS Creative Module.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this Agreement is to ensure that creative works published
          through the BBS Creative Module are protected, transparent, and accessible
          while respecting both freedom of expression and ethical standards.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>2. Rights of Authors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Authors retain full copyright and ownership of their works.</li>
          <li>Authors may remove or update their works at any time.</li>
          <li>
            BBS provides free access to publish without censorship,
            except in cases defined under responsibilities below.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>3. Responsibilities of Authors</h2>
        <p>Authors agree not to submit works that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Promote hate, discrimination, or violence.</li>
          <li>Violate laws or intellectual property rights of others.</li>
          <li>Contain harmful, exploitative, or abusive content.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>4. BBS Platform’s Role</h2>
        <p>
          BBS acts as a neutral host and transparency layer.
          It does not edit, alter, or censor works, except where strictly required
          by law or this Agreement.
          BBS provides verification tools and ensures that every submission is
          included in the public transparency log.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>5. Transparency & Public Record</h2>
        <p>
          Each creative submission is registered in the BBS Transparency Portal
          through an immutable audit log (Merkle root).
          This guarantees authenticity, prevents manipulation, and provides a
          verifiable public record of publication.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>6. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          BBS is not liable for the misuse of published works by third parties,
          to the extent permitted by applicable law.
          Responsibility lies solely with the author for the content they provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          BBS ensures transparency but does not act as publisher or editor.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>7. Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          By checking the consent box in the Creative Module submission form,
          the author confirms that they have read, understood, and accepted
          this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Agreement becomes binding upon acceptance,
          to the extent permitted by applicable law.
