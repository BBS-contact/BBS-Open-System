# 2. Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to:

* the public repository infrastructure,
* associated project documentation,
* any communication initiated via provided contact email.

At the current development stage, the Foundation does not operate a standalone public website with active user data collection mechanisms.

---

# 3. Categories of Data Processed

At this stage, the Foundation does not actively collect personal data through forms, user accounts, or tracking systems.

However, limited technical data may be processed automatically by hosting providers, including:

* IP address,
* browser type and version,
* date and time of access,
* basic server request metadata.

Such data is processed by infrastructure providers (e.g., repository hosting services) in accordance with their own privacy policies.

The Foundation does not use:

* Google Analytics,
* advertising tracking systems,
* profiling tools,
* behavioral monitoring technologies.

---

# 4. Legal Basis (GDPR Article 6)

Where technical data processing occurs, it is based on:

* Article 6(1)(f) GDPR — legitimate interest (system security, integrity monitoring, and infrastructure stability),
* Article 6(1)(b) GDPR — communication response when a user initiates contact.

No automated decision-making or profiling is performed.

---

# 5. Data Retention

The Foundation does not maintain independent databases of visitor data.

Any technical logs retained by hosting providers are governed by their internal retention policies.

Email correspondence is retained only as necessary for:

* responding to inquiries,
* maintaining institutional documentation integrity,
* legal compliance obligations.

---

# 6. Data Sharing

The Foundation does not sell, rent, or commercially distribute personal data.

Data may be processed by infrastructure providers strictly for technical hosting and security purposes.

No cross-border data transfers are initiated by the Foundation beyond those inherent to infrastructure hosting providers.

* request access to their personal data,
* request rectification,
* request erasure (where legally applicable),
* request restriction of processing,

* lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

In Poland, the supervisory authority is:

President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO).

Requests may be submitted to the contact email listed above.

# 8. Security Measures

The Foundation applies structural integrity principles to protect documentation and communications, including:

* controlled access management,
* no embedded tracking scripts,
* no hidden profiling mechanisms,
* secure email communication practices.

Security is implemented proportionally to the current scale of operations.

---
