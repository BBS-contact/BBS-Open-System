  <section>
    <h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
    <p>This Policy defines the governance framework for the development, testing, and deployment of artificial intelligence systems within Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System ("Foundation"), including the LEO system.</p>
    <p>The Policy applies to research, analytical, and advisory AI systems developed or used in connection with the Foundation’s statutory objectives.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Regulatory Alignment</h2>
    <p>AI-related activities are conducted in alignment with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR);</li>
      <li>Applicable Polish data protection laws;</li>
      <li>The EU Artificial Intelligence Act framework (risk-based approach);</li>
      <li>Relevant sectoral and information security regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Foundation monitors regulatory developments and adjusts internal procedures accordingly.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Risk-Based Classification</h2>
    <p>AI systems are assessed using a proportional risk-based methodology consistent with the EU AI Act model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Minimal risk systems</strong> – documentation and transparency requirements;</li>
      <li><strong>Limited risk systems</strong> – user information and traceability safeguards;</li>
      <li><strong>Higher-risk systems</strong> – enhanced documentation, testing, monitoring, and human oversight mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where required, risk assessments and impact evaluations are formally documented.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Human Oversight and Accountability</h2>
    <p>AI systems operated by the Foundation function as advisory and analytical tools. Final decisions remain under human authority.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No fully autonomous legal or administrative decision-making is delegated to AI;</li>
      <li>Critical outputs are subject to review by designated human operators;</li>
      <li>Clear responsibility remains with the Management Board and authorized personnel.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Governance and Security</h2>
    <p>AI systems operate under the Foundation’s Privacy Policy and internal data governance standards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data minimization and purpose limitation principles apply;</li>
      <li>Access controls and integrity safeguards are implemented;</li>
      <li>Where required, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) are conducted.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Transparency and Documentation</h2>
    <p>The Foundation maintains internal documentation concerning system architecture, versioning, and risk controls.</p>
    <p>Public-facing explanations are provided where legally appropriate and without compromising security or intellectual property protections.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Prohibited Practices</h2>
    <p>The Foundation does not develop or deploy AI systems for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unlawful surveillance or covert profiling;</li>
      <li>Manipulation of individuals in violation of fundamental rights;</li>
      <li>Discriminatory or unjustified bias-based decision systems;</li>
      <li>Activities prohibited under the EU AI Act or applicable law.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Review and Updates</h2>
    <p>This Policy is reviewed periodically and updated where required by regulatory developments or operational changes.</p>
    <p>The legally binding framework remains the applicable EU and Polish law.</p>
