# Identity Module — Ethical and Secure Digital Identity Infrastructure

The Identity module provides the technical foundation for creating,
managing, and verifying digital identities within the BBS ecosystem.

It is closely connected to **BBS-ID** but focuses on the **technical** layer:
secure records, credential handling, document management, and
interoperability across institutions.

Core algorithms remain protected.  
This file describes the public architecture overview.

## Objectives

### • Minimal data philosophy  
Only necessary data is stored. No excessive collection.

### • Distributed security  
Identity is protected without relying on a single central authority.

### • Tamper-resistant records  
All identity changes and validations leave immutable audit trails.

### • Universal compatibility  
Works across BBS modules, institutions, and international frameworks.

### • Fraud prevention  
Detects impersonation, manipulation, and unauthorized changes.

## System Components (Public Overview)

1. **Identity Record Layer**  
   Stores the minimal identity markers required for secure verification.

2. **Credential Management Engine**  
   Handles creation, renewal, and revocation of digital credentials.

3. **Document Registry Interface**  
   Connects identity with verified documents (IDs, certificates, licenses).

4. **Cross-Module Authorization Hub**  
   Enables secure access to services across the BBS ecosystem.

5. **Integrity & Audit Flow**  
   Logs all identity actions with cryptographic timestamps.

## Security Principles

- No hidden access  
- No silent data collection  
- No external monetization of identity  
- Full transparency of how identity is used  
- User-first ethical governance

## Why It Matters

Modern identity systems often struggle with:

- centralization  
- fraud  
- data breaches  
- political influence  
- opaque operations  

BBS provides a new standard:  
secure, ethical, transparent, distributed, and user-controlled identity.

## Development Status

The technical identity framework is in active development.
Implementation will be released gradually after full ethical
and legal validation.
