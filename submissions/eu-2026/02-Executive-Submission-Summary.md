# Executive Submission Summary  
Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System  
2026

## 1. Institutional Overview

Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System is a Polish non-profit foundation focused on research in structured digital governance and AI-supported advisory systems.

The Foundation develops LEO (Logical Epistemic Oversight), a modular research architecture designed to improve documentation traceability, decision-support transparency, and regulatory alignment in complex institutional environments.

LEO is not an autonomous decision-maker.  
It operates strictly as an advisory and documentation-support framework.

## 2. Problem Context

Across public and institutional systems within the EU, recurring structural challenges include:

- fragmented documentation processes,
- limited traceability of complex decisions,
- difficulty auditing multi-layer administrative workflows,
- increasing regulatory complexity in AI governance.

These challenges create administrative inefficiencies and reduce institutional transparency.

---

## 3. Research Objective

The Foundation’s research objective is to explore how structured, compliance-aware digital architectures can:

- strengthen procedural traceability,
- support structured decision-support documentation,
- integrate AI risk classification mechanisms,
- improve audit-readiness without replacing human authority.

The project emphasizes proportionality, modularity, and regulatory alignment.

## 4. System Characteristics

LEO research focuses on:

- modular system architecture,
- human-in-the-loop oversight,
- structured logging and version tracking,
- advisory AI components under risk classification,
- compliance-aware documentation modeling.

The system does not claim systemic invulnerability or absolute guarantees.

## 5. Regulatory Alignment

Development activities consider alignment with:

- GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679),
- EU Artificial Intelligence Act,
- EU data governance principles,
- Polish foundation law.

The Foundation operates within a research and pilot-readiness framework.

---

## 6. Current Phase

The initiative is currently in:

- structured architectural stabilization,
- documentation harmonization,
- pilot framework preparation,
- institutional compliance consolidation.

The Foundation seeks structured cooperation within EU-supported programs focused on trustworthy AI and digital governance research.

---

## 7. Intended Impact

Expected research-level impact includes:

- improved documentation transparency models,
- structured audit traceability frameworks,
- AI governance experimentation within compliance boundaries,
- reproducible pilot-ready research architecture.

All impact remains proportional and context-dependent.
