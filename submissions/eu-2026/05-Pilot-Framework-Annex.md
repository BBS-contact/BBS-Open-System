## 1. Purpose

This annex defines the operational structure for limited-scope pilot research activities conducted under institutional cooperation agreements.

Pilots are research-oriented and do not constitute mandatory system adoption or full institutional deployment.

---

## 2. Preconditions for Pilot Initiation

Before any pilot activity begins, the following conditions must be satisfied:

- Formal written cooperation agreement  
- Defined pilot scope and boundaries  
- Regulatory feasibility review  
- GDPR and data protection assessment  
- Human oversight designation  
- Defined evaluation criteria  

Pilots are reversible and proportionate.

## 3. Scope of Pilot Activities

Pilot research may include:

- Documentation traceability modeling  
- Structured workflow mapping  
- Advisory AI testing under human supervision  
- Audit-support simulation environments  

The system operates strictly as advisory support.

No legally binding decisions are issued by automated components.

## 4. Technical Safeguards

Pilot environments include:

- Controlled access management  
- Structured logging  
- Version tracking  
- Configuration documentation  
- Change traceability  

Absolute security guarantees are not claimed.

## 5. Governance and Oversight

During pilot operation:

- Human authority remains primary  
- AI outputs are advisory only  
- Documentation pathways remain auditable  
- Data usage is proportionate and defined  

Oversight mechanisms are established in cooperation agreements.

## 6. Evaluation and Exit Conditions

Pilot continuation requires:

- Structured evaluation report  
- Risk reassessment  
- Regulatory review update  
- Mutual institutional consent  

Expansion beyond pilot scope requires new formal agreements.
