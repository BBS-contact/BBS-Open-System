To Whom It May Concern,

Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System is a registered Polish non-profit foundation focused on research in structured digital governance, transparency-enhancing architectures, and AI risk-aware advisory systems.

We are submitting this institutional overview to present our research initiative, LEO (Logical Epistemic Oversight), as a laboratory-developed governance-support framework aligned with European regulatory standards.

The Foundation operates under Polish law and conducts its activities within a structured research and pilot-evaluation context. Our objective is not to replace institutional authority, but to explore how modular, traceable, and compliance-oriented digital architectures can strengthen documentation integrity, decision-support transparency, and AI risk management practices.

Current development efforts focus on:

- structured audit traceability mechanisms,
- advisory AI modules with human oversight integration,
- compliance-aware system design,
- pilot-ready research frameworks suitable for limited-scope institutional cooperation.

All development activities are aligned with:

- Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR),
- the EU Artificial Intelligence Act,
- relevant EU data governance principles,
- Polish foundation and accounting law.

We welcome structured dialogue, research collaboration, and participation in European programs that support responsible digital transformation and trustworthy AI development.

Should further clarification or documentation be required, we remain available for formal institutional communication.

Respectfully,

Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System  
Poland
