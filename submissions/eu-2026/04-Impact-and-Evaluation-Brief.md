# Impact and Evaluation Brief  
Fundacja BBS — Better Balance System  
2026

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the anticipated research-level impact of the LEO initiative and the evaluation methodology applied within pilot and laboratory environments.

Impact statements refer to proportional research outcomes and do not constitute systemic guarantees.

---

## 2. Intended Research-Level Impact

The initiative aims to contribute to:

- Improved documentation traceability models  
- Structured decision-support transparency  
- AI risk classification awareness in governance contexts  
- Audit-support architecture experimentation  
- Compliance-aware system modeling  

All outcomes are dependent on pilot scope and institutional context.

## 3. Impact Categories

### 3.1 Procedural Transparency

Evaluation of structured logging, documentation clarity, and traceable analytical workflows.

### 3.2 AI Governance Readiness

Assessment of human oversight integration, advisory AI boundaries, and risk classification structures.

### 3.3 Audit Support Modeling

Testing reproducible documentation pathways suitable for inspection and review.

### 3.4 Institutional Usability

Stakeholder feedback on clarity, interpretability, and proportional complexity.

## 4. Evaluation Methodology

Impact is assessed through:

- Structured pilot feedback  
- Documentation completeness metrics  
- Traceability testing  
- Compliance review checkpoints  
- Iterative refinement cycles  

Evaluation is proportional and iterative.

## 5. Risk and Limitation Acknowledgment

The Foundation recognizes:

- Context-dependent variability  
- Institutional heterogeneity  
- Regulatory constraints  
- The necessity of human authority in decision processes  

No claim of absolute automation or systemic transformation is made.

---

## 6. Long-Term Perspective

The project seeks gradual research validation through:

- Controlled pilot environments  
- Institutional partnerships  
- Academic collaboration  
- Regulatory dialogue  

Progress is incremental and evidence-based.
