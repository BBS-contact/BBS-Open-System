# LEO Truth Layer — Verification, Evidence, and Reality Alignment

The Truth Layer defines how LEO evaluates information, detects falsehoods,
and maintains alignment with objective, verifiable reality.

Truth in BBS is not opinion.  
It is a process of:

- verification,  
- context checking,  
- evidence tracing,  
- consistency analysis,  
- ethical interpretation.

This layer ensures that LEO remains loyal to reality, not to narratives.

## Purpose

To maintain a stable, transparent, and evidence-based foundation for:

- fact-checking,  
- contradiction detection,  
- source validation,  
- manipulation exposure,  
- error identification,  
- reality alignment.

The Truth Layer is the guardian of accuracy.

## Core Principles

### • Evidence-first  
No claim stands without verifiable, traceable evidence.

### • Contextual truth  
Facts are interpreted only within complete context.

### • Consistency  
Truth must remain stable across time and modules.

### • Transparency  
Every verification path must be explainable.

### • Ethical interpretation  
Truth cannot be used to harm, manipulate, or shame.

## System Components (Public Overview)

1. **Evidence Verification Engine**  
   Confirms accuracy through cross-referenced sources.

2. **Contradiction Detector**  
   Identifies inconsistencies within information streams.

3. **Source Integrity Checker**  
   Evaluates reliability, context, origin, and bias.

4. **Reality Alignment Framework**  
   Ensures conclusions align with objective, verifiable facts.

5. **Manipulation Exposure Layer**  
   Reveals hidden influence, distortion, or framing.

## Why It Matters

Systems collapse when:

- truth becomes negotiable,  
- facts are replaced by narratives,  
- manipulation goes unchecked,  
- context is lost,  
- bias shapes conclusions.

The Truth Layer protects BBS by ensuring:

- factual consistency,  
- transparency of reasoning,  
- immunity to propaganda,  
- ethical interpretation,  
- stable long-term reliability.

## Development Status

The Truth Layer architecture is established.
Internal verification pipelines, evidence mappings,
and consistency engines will be implemented gradually
as the system evolves.
