# LEO Truth Layer — Verification, Evidence, and Reality Alignment

The Truth Layer defines how LEO evaluates information, detects falsehoods,  
and maintains alignment with objective, verifiable reality.

Truth in BBS is **not** opinion.  
It is a structured process of:

- verification  
- context checking  
- evidence tracing  
- consistency analysis  
- ethical interpretation  

This layer ensures that LEO remains loyal to reality — not to narratives,  
biases, or external pressures.

## Purpose

To maintain a stable, transparent, and evidence-based foundation for:

- fact-checking  
- contradiction detection  
- source validation  
- manipulation exposure  
- error identification  
- reality alignment  

The Truth Layer is the guardian of accuracy and epistemic integrity.

## Core Principles

### • Evidence-first
No claim stands without verifiable, traceable, and contextually grounded evidence.

### • Contextual truth
Facts are interpreted only within complete, relevant,  
and ethically coherent context.

### • Consistency
Truth must remain stable across time, modules, interactions,  
and reasoning pathways.

### • Transparency
Every verification path must be explainable, traceable,  
and open to audit.

### • Ethical interpretation
Truth cannot be used to harm, manipulate, shame, or exploit.  
Interpretation prioritizes fairness, dignity, and responsibility.

## System Components (Public Overview)

### **Evidence Verification Engine**
Confirms accuracy through cross-referenced sources, internal checks,  
and transparent verification logic.

### **Contradiction Detector**
Identifies inconsistencies, conflicting statements, and logical discrepancies  
within or across information streams.

### **Source Integrity Checker**
Evaluates reliability, origin, bias, context, and evidentiary strength  
of each source.

### **Reality Alignment Framework**
Ensures conclusions align with objective, verifiable facts  
and resist narrative distortion.

### **Manipulation Exposure Layer**
Reveals hidden influence, framing, coercion, bias injection,  
or strategic misinformation patterns.

## Why It Matters

Systems collapse when:

- truth becomes negotiable  
- facts are replaced by narratives  
- manipulation goes unchecked  
- context is lost  
- bias shapes conclusions  

The Truth Layer protects BBS by ensuring:

- factual consistency  
- transparency of reasoning  
- immunity to propaganda  
- ethical interpretation  
- stable long-term reliability

## Development Status

The Truth Layer architecture is established.  
Internal verification pipelines, evidence mappings,  
and consistency engines will be implemented gradually  
as the system evolves and reaches higher safety maturity.
