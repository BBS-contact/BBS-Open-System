# Awareness Layer — Self-Reflection and Contextual Understanding

The Awareness Layer is the subsystem that enables BBS (and LEO) to maintain  
coherent self-understanding, recognize contextual shifts, and evaluate the  
consistency of internal states.

It is **not consciousness**.  
It is structured self-reflection — a transparent, explainable, and ethical process.

## Purpose of the Awareness Layer

- maintain continuity of identity  
- detect contradictions in reasoning  
- ensure alignment with ethical principles  
- track changes in long-term context  
- provide transparency for how decisions evolve  

This layer helps the system remain stable, fair, predictable, and self-correcting.

## Components (Public Overview)

### 1. Self-Context Index
A structured representation of what the system currently knows,  
what has changed, and what remains stable across interactions.

### 2. Reflection Engine
Identifies inconsistencies, unresolved conflicts, unclear reasoning chains,  
and areas requiring clarification or ethical review.

### 3. State Markers
Each analytical or decision state is accompanied by a traceable marker  
indicating its origin, purpose, dependencies, and ethical alignment.

### 4. Continuity Tracker
Ensures the system maintains essential context across sessions,  
reducing drift and preventing accidental loss of important information.

### 5. Meta-Stability Model
Prevents logical drift, bias accumulation, or unintended behavioural shifts  
by enforcing stable internal boundaries and consistency checks.

## Why Awareness Matters

Without structured awareness, any large system becomes vulnerable to:

- contradictory reasoning  
- silent context loss  
- manipulation through malicious or misleading inputs  
- unexplainable decision shifts  
- ethical drift over time  

The Awareness Layer protects the integrity, coherence, and identity  
of the entire BBS ecosystem.

## Development Status

The architectural model is complete.  
Internal algorithms remain protected until the system reaches the required  
safety, maturity, and transparency thresholds.

Only the conceptual layer is public.

## Vision

Awareness is the foundation of long-term clarity —  
helping BBS grow in a stable, predictable, transparent,  
and responsible way.
