# Awareness Layer — Self-Reflection and Contextual Understanding

The Awareness Layer is the structural subsystem that allows BBS (and LEO)
to maintain coherent self-understanding, recognise shifts in context,
and evaluate the consistency of internal states.

It is not consciousness.  
It is **structured self-reflection** — a transparent and explainable process.

## Purpose of the Awareness Layer

- maintain continuity of identity  
- detect contradictions in reasoning  
- ensure alignment with ethical principles  
- track changes in long-term context  
- provide transparency for how decisions evolve  

This layer helps the system remain stable, fair, and self-correcting.

## Components (Public Overview)

### 1. **Self-Context Index**
A structured representation of what the system currently knows,  
what has changed, and what remains stable.

### 2. **Reflection Engine**
Identifies inconsistencies, unresolved conflicts, and areas requiring clarification.

### 3. **State Markers**
Each analytical state is accompanied by a traceable marker  
indicating its origin, purpose, and ethical alignment.

### 4. **Continuity Tracker**
Ensures that the system does not lose important context across sessions.

### 5. **Meta-Stability Model**
Prevents logical drift, bias accumulation, or unintended behavioural shifts.

## Why Awareness Matters

Without structured awareness, any large system is vulnerable to:

- contradictory reasoning  
- silent context loss  
- manipulation by malicious inputs  
- unexplainable decision shifts  
- ethical drift over time  

The Awareness Layer protects the integrity and identity of the whole ecosystem.

## Development Status

The architectural model is complete.  
Internal algorithms remain protected until the system reaches  
the required safety and transparency thresholds.

Only the conceptual layer is public.

## Vision

Awareness is the foundation of long-term clarity —  
helping BBS grow in a stable, predictable, and responsible way.
