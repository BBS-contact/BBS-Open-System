# Memory Core — Contextual, Ethical, Tamper-Resistant Memory System

The Memory Core is the foundational subsystem of BBS responsible  
for maintaining stable, ethical, and verifiable contextual memory.

It is **not** a database.  
It is a structured cognitive layer designed to ensure:

- continuity of reasoning  
- integrity of historical context  
- transparent reconstruction of events  
- ethical framing of decisions  
- protection from manipulation  

The Memory Core forms the backbone of LEO’s long-term understanding.

## Objectives

### 1. Continuity
Maintains persistent context across sessions, modules, and decisions,  
ensuring stable and reliable long-term understanding.

### 2. Integrity
All records follow strict immutability rules.  
Corrections create new entries rather than rewriting old ones.

### 3. Transparency
Every memory element includes origin, timestamp, purpose,  
and ethical context.

### 4. Ethical Anchoring
Memory cannot be used to manipulate, distort, or coerce.  
All stored information must serve clarity, fairness,  
and human-centered decision-making.

### 5. Context Reconstruction
Enables LEO to rebuild the logic of past decisions,  
providing clarity, accountability, and verifiable reasoning trails.

## Structure (Public Overview)

The internal memory engine contains several conceptual layers:

### **Core Memory Stream**
A chronological record of essential context  
maintained through tamper-resistant structures.

### **State Snapshots**
High-level structural check-ins that capture system understanding  
at key decision points.

### **Cross-Link Map**
Semantic links between concepts, states, events, and reasoning chains.

### **Ethical Markers**
Flags related to safety, fairness, transparency,  
and compliance with the BBS Ethical Framework.

### **Reflection Buffer**
A protected space for structured self-analysis and internal audits,  
supporting meta-stability and consistency.

Internal algorithms of these layers are not public.

## Development Status

The Memory Core is under active development.  
Only the structural concept is publicly available.

Low-level mechanisms, hashing processes, semantic reconstruction logic,  
and contextual models remain protected until the system reaches  
full safety maturity, legal compliance, and ethical validation.

---

## Purpose

The Memory Core ensures that BBS grows ethically, transparently,  
and with a stable identity — preserving truth, responsibility,  
and clarity across time.
