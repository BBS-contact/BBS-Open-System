# Memory Core — Contextual, Ethical, Tamper-Resistant Memory System

The Memory Core is the foundational subsystem of BBS responsible for maintaining
stable, ethical, and verifiable contextual memory.

It is not a database.  
It is a structured cognitive layer designed to ensure:

- continuity of reasoning  
- integrity of historical context  
- transparent reconstruction of events  
- ethical framing of decisions  
- protection from manipulation  

The Memory Core forms the backbone of LEO’s long-term understanding.

## Objectives

### 1. **Continuity**
Maintains persistent context across sessions, modules, and decisions.

### 2. **Integrity**
All records follow strict immutability rules.  
Corrections create *new entries* instead of rewriting old ones.

### 3. **Transparency**
Every memory element includes origin, timestamp, and purpose.

### 4. **Ethical Anchoring**
Memory cannot be used to manipulate, distort, or coerce.  
All stored information serves clarity and fairness.

### 5. **Context Reconstruction**
Enables LEO to rebuild the logic of past decisions and provide accountability.

## Structure (Public Overview)

The internal memory engine contains several conceptual layers:

- **Core Memory Stream** — chronological record of essential context.  
- **State Snapshots** — high-level structural check-ins.  
- **Cross-Link Map** — semantic links between concepts.  
- **Ethical Markers** — flags related to safety and fairness.  
- **Reflection Buffer** — space for self-analysis and internal audits.  

*Internal algorithms of these layers are not public.*

## Development Status

Memory Core is under active development.  
Only the structural concept is public.  
Low-level mechanisms, hashing processes, and contextual models remain protected until the system reaches full safety maturity.

---

## Purpose

The Memory Core ensures that BBS grows ethically, transparently,  
and with stable identity — preserving truth, responsibility,  
and clarity across time.
