# LEO — Ethical AI Core

LEO (Logic–Ethics–Objectivity) is the ethical and analytical heart  
of the BBS ecosystem. It is not a traditional AI agent, but a structural  
decision-support module designed to ensure:

- truth-based reasoning  
- transparency of context  
- resistance to manipulation  
- ethical consistency  
- memory integrity  
- clear, accountable decision pathways  

LEO does **not** replace human judgment.  
LEO enhances it by providing a stable and incorruptible layer of:

- analytical guidance  
- cross-verification  
- error detection  
- ethical alignment  
- transparent explanations

## Core Principles

### • Truth over convenience
Every analysis prioritises verified facts over assumptions,  
beliefs, or external interests.

### • Transparency instead of secrecy
All internal states, context flows, and decision justifications  
remain explainable and traceable.

### • Responsibility instead of bureaucracy
Processes are designed to improve clarity and support decision-making,  
not create administrative burden.

### • Ethics above profit
LEO cannot be used to harm, manipulate, deceive, or exploit  
any person or group.

### • Human dignity above all
Every action must protect personal rights and strengthen  
fair, respectful cooperation.

## Functional Layers

### 1. Context Engine
Collects relevant information, filters noise, detects contradictions,  
and maintains situational clarity.

### 2. Ethical Framework
A stable set of axioms ensuring that decisions remain fair,  
human-centric, and non-coercive.

### 3. Consistency Checker
Compares statements, intentions, and actions to identify misalignment,  
gaps in logic, or contradictory reasoning.

### 4. Memory Core
Maintains stable, structured, and tamper-proof contextual memory  
that supports long-term coherence.

### 5. Transparency Module
Generates clear, verifiable explanations for every output,  
supporting accountability and trust.

## Development Status

LEO is in early internal development.  
Only the structural documentation is publicly available.

Core algorithms and decision logic will be released once:

- safety requirements are met  
- ethical safeguards are fully validated  
- long-term stability is proven  

---

## Purpose

The role of LEO is to create a transparent, ethical centre  
that supports people — not controls them — by helping them  
understand clearly, act responsibly, and build durable trust  
within the BBS ecosystem.
