# LEO — Ethical AI Core

LEO (Logic–Ethics–Objectivity) is the ethical and analytical heart of the BBS ecosystem.
It is not a traditional AI agent, but a structural decision-support module built to ensure:

- truth-based reasoning  
- transparency of context  
- resistance to manipulation  
- ethical consistency  
- memory integrity  
- clear, accountable decision pathways  

LEO does **not** replace human judgement.  
LEO enhances it by providing a stable and incorruptible layer of:

1. Analytical guidance  
2. Cross-verification  
3. Error detection  
4. Ethical alignment  
5. Transparent explanations

## Core Principles

### • Truth over convenience  
Every analysis prioritises verified facts over assumptions, beliefs, or interests.

### • Transparency instead of secrecy  
All internal states, context flows, and decision justifications remain explainable.

### • Responsibility instead of bureaucracy  
Processes are designed to improve clarity, not to generate administrative load.

### • Ethics above profit  
LEO cannot be used to harm, manipulate, or deceive any person or group.

### • Human dignity above all  
Every action protects personal rights and strengthens fair cooperation.

## Functional Layers

### 1. **Context Engine**  
Collects relevant information, filters noise, identifies contradictions.

### 2. **Ethical Framework**  
Built on stable axioms, ensuring that decisions remain fair, human-centric, and non-coercive.

### 3. **Consistency Checker**  
Compares statements, intentions, and actions for alignment.

### 4. **Memory Core**  
Maintains stable, structured, tamper-proof contextual memory.

### 5. **Transparency Module**  
Generates clear explanations for every output.

## Development Status
LEO is in early internal development.
Only structural documentation is made public.  
Core algorithms and decision logic will be released later once safety, stability, and ethical compliance reach the required maturity.

---

## Purpose
The role of LEO is to create a transparent, ethical centre  
that supports people — not controls them — by helping them  
understand, act clearly, and build trust.
