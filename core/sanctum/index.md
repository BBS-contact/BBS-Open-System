# Sanctum — Ethical Core (Public Redirect Notice)

The internal ethical protection mechanisms of LEO are distributed across:

- `/core/ethics/`
- `/core/awareness/`
- `/core/meta/`
- `/core/truth/`
- `/core/memory/`

This directory exists to maintain compatibility with earlier documentation
and prevent broken links.

“Sanctum” refers to the protected ethical core, but its technical
implementation is intentionally distributed and not exposed publicly.

Internal mechanisms remain protected for safety and integrity reasons.
