# Admin Logs — Transparent Event and Action Record System

The Logs Panel provides a clear and accountable view of actions,
events, warnings, and system activity inside the BBS ecosystem.

Unlike traditional logging systems, which may be editable or hidden,
BBS logs are:

- immutable  
- verifiable  
- multi-channeled  
- ethically structured  
- tied to integrity layers  

This panel serves as a transparent window into how the system behaves.

## Purpose

To provide administrators with a safe, ethical, and transparent way to:

- review system events,  
- track module activity,  
- monitor errors and warnings,  
- understand operational behaviour,  
- ensure accountability,  
- support audit processes.

All logs are **read-only**.  
No administrator can alter or delete them.

### • Error & Warning Feed

### • Integrity Log Integration  
Each log entry links to Merkle and audit records.

### • Module Activity Traces  
Provides context for actions across system modules.

### • Search & Filter Tools

## Ethical Principles

- Logs cannot be edited or erased.  
- All log access is itself logged.  
- No hidden logging channels exist.  
- Transparency does not expose private user data.  
- Logs serve clarity, not surveillance.

---

## Why It Matters

In most systems:
- logs can be erased,
- altered,
- hidden,
- manipulated,
- or stored privately.

BBS eliminates these vulnerabilities with:
- immutable logs,
- multi-channel verification,
- ethical access rules,
- public accountability.

## Development Status

The Logs Panel architecture is defined.
Integration with audit and integrity streams will be activated
as the ecosystem advances in testing and deployment.
