# Admin Logs — Transparent Event and Action Record System

The Logs Panel provides a clear and accountable view of actions, events,  
warnings, and system activity inside the BBS ecosystem.

Unlike traditional logging systems, which may be editable or hidden,  
BBS logs are:

- immutable  
- verifiable  
- multi-channeled  
- ethically structured  
- tied to integrity layers  

This panel serves as a transparent window into how the system behaves.

## Purpose

To provide administrators with a safe, ethical, and transparent way to:

- review system events  
- track module activity  
- monitor errors and warnings  
- understand operational behaviour  
- ensure accountability  
- support audit processes  

All logs are **read-only**.  
No administrator can alter or delete them.

## Core Features (Public Overview)

### • Event Stream Viewer
Displays system events in chronological, integrity-verified order.

### • Error & Warning Feed
Shows non-sensitive alerts, issues, and operational signals.

### • Integrity Log Integration
Each log entry is linked to Merkle records and audit trails,  
ensuring authenticity and immutability.

### • Module Activity Traces
Provides context for how different modules interact and operate over time.

### • Search & Filter Tools
Enables safe navigation through publicly accessible log segments  
without exposing sensitive or private data.

## Ethical Principles

- Logs cannot be edited or erased.  
- All log access is itself logged.  
- No hidden logging channels exist.  
- Transparency never exposes private user information.  
- Logs serve clarity and accountability — not surveillance.

---

## Why It Matters

In most systems:

- logs can be erased  
- altered  
- hidden  
- manipulated  
- or stored privately  

These vulnerabilities enable corruption, cover-ups, and misuse of power.

BBS eliminates these risks through:

- immutable logs  
- multi-channel verification  
- ethical access rules  
- public accountability  

This ensures transparent and trustworthy system stewardship.

## Development Status

The Logs Panel architecture is defined.  
Integration with audit trails and integrity streams  
will be activated as the ecosystem progresses  
through testing, verification, and deployment stages.
