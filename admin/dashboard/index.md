# Admin Dashboard — System Overview and Operational Control

The Admin Dashboard is the central interface for monitoring and managing
the BBS ecosystem at a high level. It provides authorized personnel
with a transparent view of system health, integrity, performance,
and module activity.

This dashboard does **not** grant hidden power or unrestricted control.  
It follows the ethical principle:  
**administration = responsibility, not authority.**

---

## Purpose

To provide a clear, accountable interface for:
- monitoring system activity,
- reviewing integrity status,
- overseeing module performance,
- coordinating technical maintenance,
- ensuring ethical and transparent operations.

No action here bypasses integrity or ethical rules.

## Ethical Principles

- no superuser privileges  
- no hidden controls  
- no ability to override integrity  
- all actions are logged and verified  

Administrators operate **within the same ethical boundaries** as all users.

---

## Why It Matters

Administrative power is a major source of corruption in traditional systems.
BBS eliminates this risk by:

- removing privileged backdoors,
- making all admin actions accountable,
- ensuring transparent system stewardship,
- enforcing ethical responsibilities.

---

## Development Status

The dashboard structure is defined.
Implementation of monitoring and integrity interfaces
will be expanded as system modules reach operational maturity.
