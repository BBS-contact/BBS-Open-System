# System Monitor — Real-Time Operational Insight Panel

The System Monitor provides a high-level, real-time view
of the operational health of the BBS ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that the system remains stable,
healthy, transparent, and resistant to failures or manipulation.

The monitor does not grant control —  
it provides **visibility without authority**.

## Purpose

To offer safe and ethical observability into:

- module activity,
- performance metrics,
- server health,
- communication flows,
- integrity signals,
- anomaly detection.

This panel is an informational interface only.  
No action here modifies the system.

## Core Features (Public Overview)

### • Performance Overview  
Displays resource usage, module load, and system responsiveness.

### • Module Status Grid  
Shows real-time state of each major subsystem (green/yellow/red indicators).

### • Connection Health Panel  
Monitors inter-module communication and data flow stability.

### • Integrity Pulse  
Shows high-level Merkle, audit, and timeline consistency checks.

### • Anomaly Feed  
Lists potentially suspicious or abnormal system patterns.

## Ethical Principles

- Pure observability, no control.  
- No hidden data.  
- No privileged administrative access.  
- All monitor activity is logged.  
- No personal user information is shown.

Monitoring is a responsibility, not a power.

## Why It Matters

Traditional monitoring systems often give admins deep control,
creating a massive corruption and manipulation risk.

BBS solves this by:

- separating visibility from authority,
- ensuring that admins cannot change what they observe,
- protecting the system from insider threats,
- enforcing transparent, ethical operations.

## Development Status

The Monitor structure is defined.
Integration with real-time metrics, health checks,
and anomaly detection will grow as the ecosystem reaches
later development stages.
