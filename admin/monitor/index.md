# System Monitor — Real-Time Operational Insight Panel

The System Monitor provides a high-level, real-time view of the operational  
health of the BBS ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that the system remains stable, healthy, transparent,  
and resistant to failures or manipulation.

The monitor does **not** grant control —  
it provides **visibility without authority**.

---

## Purpose

To offer safe and ethical observability into:

- module activity  
- performance metrics  
- server health  
- communication flows  
- integrity signals  
- anomaly detection  

This panel is an informational interface only.  
No action here can modify or influence the system.

## Core Features (Public Overview)

### • Performance Overview
Displays resource usage, module load, system responsiveness,  
and operational balance.

### • Module Status Grid
Shows real-time state of each major subsystem  
with clear green/yellow/red indicators.

### • Connection Health Panel
Monitors inter-module communication, data flow stability,  
and operational consistency.

### • Integrity Pulse
Shows high-level Merkle verification, audit signals,  
and timeline consistency indicators.

### • Anomaly Feed
Lists unusual, potentially suspicious, or abnormal patterns  
detected across the ecosystem.

## Ethical Principles

- pure observability, **no control**  
- no hidden data streams  
- no privileged administrative access  
- all monitor activity is itself logged  
- no personal user data is displayed  
- monitoring is a **responsibility**, not a power  

---

## Why It Matters

Traditional monitoring systems often give administrators deep control,  
creating major corruption, abuse, and manipulation risks.

BBS eliminates these risks by:

- separating visibility from authority  
- ensuring admins cannot change what they observe  
- protecting the system from insider threats  
- enforcing transparent and ethical operations  

This keeps monitoring accountable and aligned with public trust.

## Development Status

The Monitor structure is defined.  
Integration with real-time metrics, health checks,  
and anomaly detection systems will expand as the ecosystem  
reaches later development and deployment stages.
