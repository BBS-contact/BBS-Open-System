# Settings — Ethical and Transparent System Configuration

The Settings Panel defines how the BBS ecosystem is configured.  
It provides access only to safe, transparent, and non-destructive parameters  
that do **not** override integrity, ethical rules, or security models.

In BBS, settings do **not** grant hidden power.  
They enable responsible stewardship — not control.

## Purpose

To offer a clear, safe, and ethical interface for adjusting:

- non-critical system parameters  
- display and interface preferences  
- module-level configurations  
- notification rules  
- maintenance intervals  
- integration settings  

No setting can bypass security, integrity, or ethical safeguards.

## Core Principles

### • No privileged manipulation  
Administrators cannot change rules that affect integrity, security, or truth.

### • Transparency  
All configuration changes are logged, traceable, and publicly verifiable.

### • Ethical alignment  
Settings exist only to support fairness, clarity, and user safety.

### • Controlled scope  
Only safe, non-destructive parameters can be modified.

### • Shared accountability  
Multiple checks ensure responsible, ethical configuration changes.

## System Components (Public Overview)

### **Configuration Interface**  
Provides access to allowed, ethically safe settings without touching core mechanics.

### **Change Log Register**  
Records every configuration modification with immutable integrity markers.

### **Module Settings Map**  
Shows which parameters each subsystem allows for safe configuration.

### **Maintenance Tools**  
Enables scheduled updates, cleanup routines, and safe maintenance workflows.

### **Notification Control Panel**  
Adjusts how the system communicates non-sensitive alerts and events.

## Why It Matters

In most systems, configuration settings act as a backdoor for:

- corruption  
- manipulation  
- privilege escalation  
- hidden operational changes  

BBS eliminates these risks by ensuring:

- settings cannot override safeguards  
- no secret switches or admin backdoors exist  
- all changes are visible and logged  
- administrators remain accountable  
- the ethical foundation remains untouched  

The system stays trustworthy — regardless of who configures it.

## Development Status

The Settings architecture is defined.  
Expanded configuration options will be enabled gradually  
as system modules reach higher maturity, stability, and safety levels.
