# Settings — Ethical and Transparent System Configuration

The Settings Panel defines how the BBS ecosystem is configured.
It provides access only to safe, transparent, and non-destructive parameters
that do not override integrity, ethical rules, or security models.

In BBS, settings do not grant hidden power.  
They enable responsible **stewardship**, not control.

---

## Purpose

To offer a clear, safe, and ethical interface for adjusting:

- non-critical system parameters,
- display and interface preferences,
- module-level configurations,
- notification rules,
- maintenance intervals,
- integration settings.

No setting can bypass security, integrity, or ethical safeguards.

## Core Principles

### • No privileged manipulation  
Administrators cannot change rules that affect integrity or truth.

### • Transparency  
All configuration changes are logged and verifiable.

### • Ethical alignment  
Settings are designed to support fairness, clarity, and user safety.

### • Controlled scope  
Only safe, non-destructive parameters can be modified.

### • Shared accountability  
Multiple checks ensure responsible changes.

## System Components (Public Overview)

1. **Configuration Interface**  
   Provides access to allowed and ethically safe settings.

2. **Change Log Register**  
   Records every configuration modification.

3. **Module Settings Map**  
   Displays available parameters for each subsystem.

4. **Maintenance Tools**  
   Enables safe, scheduled updates and health routines.

5. **Notification Control Panel**  
   Adjusts how the system communicates non-sensitive alerts.

## Why It Matters

In most systems, configuration settings are a backdoor
for corruption, manipulation, or privilege escalation.

BBS eliminates that risk by ensuring:

- settings cannot override safeguards,
- no secret switches exist,
- all changes are visible,
- administrators remain accountable,
- the system's ethical backbone remains untouched.

## Development Status

The Settings architecture is defined.
Expanded configuration options will be enabled gradually
as system modules reach higher maturity levels.
