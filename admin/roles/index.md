# Roles & Responsibilities — Ethical Access Model

The Roles module defines responsibility-based access in the BBS ecosystem.
It replaces traditional hierarchical privilege systems with an ethical model
centered on behaviour, trust, and intention.

Roles do not grant uncontrolled power.  
They define **responsibility**, not **authority**.

---

## Purpose

To support a transparent and fair structure where:

- no user has hidden privileges,
- no administrator can bypass integrity,
- responsibility is clearly defined,
- access grows with ethical consistency,
- and all access decisions are explainable.

This system eliminates corruption at the level of permissions.

## Core Principles

### • Responsibility over privilege  
Roles describe what a user must care for — not what they can control.

### • Ethics-first access  
Access is granted based on behaviour, intention, and trustworthiness.

### • No silent authorities  
No “superuser”, no “root”, no invisible powers.

### • Transparent access history  
Every granted access and every attempted action is logged.

### • Revocable, adaptive access  
Roles evolve with the user’s ethical behaviour.

## System Components (Public Overview)

1. **Role Definition Layer**  
   Lists responsibility-based roles without giving decision power.

2. **Ethical Access Evaluator**  
   Determines if a user’s behaviour aligns with required standards.

3. **Responsibility Maps**  
   Connect modules with responsible users or teams.

4. **Access Attempt Log**  
   Records successful and unsuccessful access attempts.

5. **Adaptive Trust Framework**  
   Trust levels grow or decrease based on ethical consistency.

## Why It Matters

Traditional permission systems fail because:

- privileged users can do anything,
- insiders can manipulate data,
- access rules are hidden,
- corruption is easy to hide.

BBS solves this through:

- zero-privilege architecture,
- ethical access control,
- full transparency,
- behaviour-based responsibility,
- immutable access trails.

No one can exploit hidden power in BBS.

## Development Status

Roles & Responsibilities architecture is complete.
Adaptive trust models, access maps, and behaviour evaluators
will be incorporated as the system evolves.
