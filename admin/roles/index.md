# Roles & Responsibilities — Ethical Access Model

The Roles module defines responsibility-based access in the BBS ecosystem.  
It replaces traditional hierarchical privilege systems with an ethical model  
centered on behaviour, trust, and intention.

Roles do **not** grant uncontrolled power.  
They define **responsibility**, not authority.

---

## Purpose

To support a transparent and fair structure where:

- no user has hidden privileges  
- no administrator can bypass integrity  
- responsibility is clearly defined  
- access grows through ethical consistency  
- all access decisions are explainable  

This system eliminates corruption at the level of permissions.

## Core Principles

### • Responsibility over privilege  
Roles describe what a user must care for — not what they can control.

### • Ethics-first access  
Access is granted based on behaviour, intention, and demonstrated trustworthiness.

### • No silent authorities  
No “superuser”, no “root”, and no invisible or irreversible powers.

### • Transparent access history  
Every granted access and every attempted action is recorded.

### • Revocable, adaptive access  
Access evolves with ethical behaviour and can be reduced if risks appear.

## System Components (Public Overview)

### **Role Definition Layer**  
Defines responsibility-based roles without granting unilateral control.

### **Ethical Access Evaluator**  
Checks whether a user’s behaviour aligns with ethical requirements.

### **Responsibility Maps**  
Connect modules with accountable individuals or teams.

### **Access Attempt Log**  
Records successful and unsuccessful access attempts with immutable trails.

### **Adaptive Trust Framework**  
Trust levels grow or decrease according to long-term ethical consistency.

## Why It Matters

Traditional permission systems fail because:

- privileged users can do anything  
- insiders can manipulate or delete data  
- access rules are opaque  
- corruption is easy to hide  

BBS solves this through:

- zero-privilege architecture  
- ethical access control  
- transparent, immutable activity trails  
- behaviour-based responsibility  
- verifiable decision pathways  

No one can exploit hidden power within the BBS ecosystem.

## Development Status

The Roles & Responsibilities architecture is complete.  
Adaptive trust models, access maps, and behavioural evaluators  
will be incorporated as the ecosystem grows and reaches higher  
levels of stability, safety, and operational maturity.
