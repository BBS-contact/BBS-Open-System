BBS Architecture Showcase — Public Overview

This page provides a high-level, non-technical overview of the BBS architecture.
It is designed for public review, partners, researchers, and institutions that want
to understand how BBS is structured without exposing internal algorithms or sensitive details.

What Is the BBS Architecture?

The BBS architecture is a layered ethical infrastructure that connects:

• Platform Domains (17 societal modules)  
• Integrity & Anti-Corruption Layer  
• LEO — Ethical AI Core  
• Library of Knowledge and Reflection  
• Server and Communication Backbone  
• Administrative and Operational Modules  

Together they form one coherent system — not separate products.

Key Architectural Layers (Public View)

1) Platform Layer — 17 Domains

The visible, human-facing part of BBS that reflects major areas of modern society:
governance, justice, education, health, economy, environment, culture, media,
research, infrastructure, emergency systems, identity, and more.

Each domain is implemented as a transparent, modular “window” into the system,
with shared standards for ethics, data integrity, and accountability.

2) Integrity Layer — Anti-Corruption and Audit Infrastructure

This layer ensures that all important actions leave an immutable, verifiable trace.

It includes:
• Merkle-based audit chains  
• Immutable logs of actions and corrections  
• Transparency mechanisms for public oversight  
• Cross-checks between institutions  

It is designed so that no single actor can quietly rewrite history, hide a decision,
or erase evidence of misconduct.

3) LEO — Ethical AI Core

The ethical intelligence center of BBS.

LEO:
• helps analyse decisions  
• detects contradictions and risks  
• enforces ethical consistency  
• supports human decision-makers  
• refuses to be used for manipulation or corruption  

LEO does not control people.
It provides clarity, structure, and warnings — final responsibility remains with humans.

4) Library Layer — Knowledge and Self-Reflection

The Library is not just a database — it is a structured memory:

• verified knowledge  
• legal and regulatory frameworks  
• research and evidence  
• self-reflection and internal audit mechanisms  

It is here that BBS stores and analyses lessons from the past,
links facts with context, and provides a basis for responsible decisions.

5) Server & Communication Backbone

The technical communication layer:

• API gateways  
• service mesh  
• authentication and identity  
• LEO bridge  
• secure channels for interactions between modules  

This layer ensures that modules talk to each other reliably and securely,
without exposing internal logic to the public internet.

6) Administrative & Operational Modules

These are internal tools for:

• configuration  
• monitoring  
• logging  
• incident response  
• support for institutions and operators  

They are not “power centers” but service tools to maintain stability and clarity.

Design Principles of the Architecture

• Ethics first — technology must follow clearly defined principles.  
• No silent centers of power — every structural decision is traceable.  
• No “black boxes” that cannot be audited.  
• Separation of concerns — ethics, data, execution, and interfaces are clearly separated.  
• Additive design — new modules can be added without breaking the core.  

What Is Not Shown Here

This page presents only the public, conceptual structure.

It does NOT reveal:
• internal algorithms  
• security implementation details  
• cryptographic procedures  
• internal decision trees of LEO  
• operational incident-handling logic  

These elements remain protected until appropriate legal, safety, and governance
conditions are in place.

Status

The BBS architecture is:

• conceptually defined  
• structurally modelled  
• partially prototyped  
• under active refinement  

Technical details will be introduced gradually, in a controlled and transparent way,
aligned with safety, legal frameworks, and long-term public interest.

BBS is not just “a system”.
It is an attempt to build a transparent, ethical, incorruptible foundation
for how societies can function in the future.
